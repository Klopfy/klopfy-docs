This page is about the 404 error page and how to add it to your published site. If the web server cannot locate the page for a URL, it returns a 404 status code to the browser (instead of the normal 200 status code). This can happen if a visitor clicks on a broken link from within the site or a search engine or by mistyping the URL in the browser location bar. Rather than showing the visitor a blank page or a low-level error message, the web server will typically display the contents of the 404 error page (herein, the 404 page). To serve the 404 page, the web server looks for the file 404.html located at the root of the published site. The contents of this file is used in place of the HTML the visitor would have seen. The visitor is not redirected to another page, so the original URL is still visible in the browser location bar. Let’s learn how to define the 404 page and add it to your Antora site. In an Antora site, the 404 page is created using a layout template provided by the UI. For this to work, the UI must define a layout template named 404 located at the path layouts/404.hbs. Antora uses this template to generate the 404.html file, which it then outputs to the root of your published site. If you use or extend the default UI, the layout template for the 404 page is already provided for you. The 404 layout template is compiled with a reduced UI model that does not include any information about the current page (since there isn’t one) except for page.title and page.layout. The template has access to all other variables in the UI model, such as uiRootPath and site.components. Unlike for regular pages, the uiRootPath and siteRootPath template variables are root-relative paths in the 404 template. This is necessary for the 404 page to work correctly when served by the server. That’s because the 404 page content is served from whatever URL the visitor originally requested. Antora only generates the 404 page if the site.url key in the playbook has a value. The assumption is that if the site URL is specified, the site is going to be published to a web server. The value of the site.url key can either be an absolute URL or a root-relative path, as explained on the site URL page. The path segment can be non-empty, which will be addressed in the next section. If Antora does not find a layout template in the UI bundle (or supplemental UI) with the name 404, it will not generate a 404 page for your site (even if the site.url key is set in the playbook). Normally, there’s nothing else you need to do make the 404 page work. The web server automatically picks up the 404.html file at the root of the published site and uses it when the visitor lands on a missing page. However, if you’re publishing your site to a subpath of a domain (e.g., https://example.org/site-a), additional configuration is required. When the URL of your site includes a path segment, the 404 page for your site will no longer be located at the web server root. Instead, it will be located under a subpath with the rest of the files. The problem is, the web server doesn’t know this subpath is significant (meaning it doesn’t know the subpath is the boundary of a discrete site). As a result, the web server will not know to serve this 404 page in place of a missing page. So we have to tell it to do so. We must configure the web server to use the 404 page under the subpath (e.g., /site-a/404.html) instead of the one at the default location (i.e., /404.html) when serving files for the site. Here are the three steps required to get this set up. We’ll assume the domain is example.com, the subpath is site-a, and the web server is nginx. Define site.url with the subpath in the playbook file, either using an absolute URL: site: url: https://example.com/site-a or a root-relative path: site: url: /site-a The site URL defined in the playbook must include the subpath. Otherwise, the URLs in the 404 page will not be correct (e.g., the URL for the CSS file). Configure nginx to use the 404.html from the subpath folder for any missing URL that falls under that subpath: location /site-a/ { error_page 404 /site-a/404.html; } Adjust the subpath location to match the subpath for your site. Copy the site files generated by Antora to the subpath under the web server root: $ rsync -r --delete build/site/ /usr/share/nginx/html/site-a In other words, the subpath folder must be located in the web server root or the root of the virtual host.

The benefit of this approach is that you can bypass installing Antora and get right down to running it. All you need is Docker or Podman. Assumptions: You have Docker (command: docker) or Podman (command: podman) installed on your machine. The Docker daemon is running on your machine (not required when using Podman). You have configured your own playbook or you’re using the Demo playbook. On this page, you’ll learn: How to run Antora inside a container using the official Docker image for Antora. How to give the container access to a local directory. How to extend the Docker image for Antora to create your own image. Docker is a tool for running container images (officially OCI images). You can think of a container image as an application in a box. Inside that box is everything you need to run the application, including the code, the runtime, the settings, and even the operating system itself. Containers not only isolate software from the host environment, they also make it easy to get up and running quickly. And that’s a perfect way to discover and explore Antora! The Antora project provides an official Docker (OCI) image named antora/antora for running Antora inside a container. This image is published to the antora/antora project on Docker Hub. This image is a drop-in replacement for the antora command. Rather than installing the antora command on your own computer or in a CI environment, you simply run the command by running the container. In fact, the CI job for the Antora documentation site uses this image to generate the documentation you’re currently reading. Let’s find out how to run it. To demonstrate how to use this image, we’ll be using the Antora demo site. Start by cloning the playbook repository for the demo site, then switch to the newly created folder: ~ $ git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/docs-site.git && cd \"$(basename $_ .git)\" Next, execute the docker run command to invoke the entrypoint command (i.e., antora) for this image using the Docker client: docs-site $ docker run -u $(id -u) -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml This command spins up a new container from the image, mounts the current directory as the path /antora inside the container, runs the antora command (as the current user), then stops and removes the container. It’s exactly like running a locally installed antora command, only you’re using container superpowers to do it! Fix the permission denied error when accessing /.cache If your local uid (i.e., $(id -u)) is not 1000, you may encounter the following error when running Antora in the container: error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/.cache' This happens because the default cache directory is resolved relative to the user’s home directory and the home directory of an unmapped user is /. That’s why you see the path /.cache in the message, which is not a writable location. The solution to this problem is to modify the location of the cache directory. Alternately, you can execute the podman run command to invoke the entrypoint command for this image using Podman: docs-site $ podman run -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml The advantage of Podman is that it’s more secure. It runs in user space and does not rely on a daemon. To continue using Podman, replace docker with podman (and drop the -u option) in any of the commands below. If you use the volume mapping $PWD:/antora:Z, you may notice that local paths reported by Antora don’t map back to your system. That’s because, as far as Antora is concerned, /antora is the current working directory. To remedy this problem, you need to map your current working directory into the container, then switch to it before running Antora. To do so, use this volume mount instead: -v $PWD:$PWD:Z -w $PWD Notice the addition of the -w option. This option tells Antora to switch from /antora to the directory you have mapped. Now, when Antora reports local paths, they will match paths on your host system. Here are explanations for some of the option flags used in the run command: -t This flag allocates a pseudo-TTY, which is required if you want to see progress bars for git operations. If you don’t need to see these progress bars, you can omit this flag. -u $(id -u) This option tells Docker to run the entrypoint command (i.e., antora) as the current user. If you use the :Z modifier on the volume mount without specifying this option, the generated files are (most likely) written as the root user (and thus become rather tricky to delete). This option is not required when using Podman. -v A volume mount that maps the current directory on your local system (represented by $PWD) to the /antora directory inside the container. This allows files written by the container to be visible on your local system, which is the whole point of using the container. :Z (on the volume mount) This flag is only required if you’re running a Linux distribution that has SELinux enabled, such as Fedora. This option allows you to use volume mounts when running SELinux. -w This option tells Docker to switch to the specified directory (i.e., $PWD) before invoking the entrypoint command. You will use this option if you want to run the antora command from a directory other than /antora inside the container. Although tempting, the --privileged flag is not needed. To learn more about using volume mounts with SELinux, see the blog post Using Volumes with Docker can Cause Problems with SELinux. If Antora cannot write the default cache directory, or you simply want the cache directory to be located inside the mounted directory, specify a playbook-relative directory using the --cache-dir option: docs-site $ docker run -u $(id -u) -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t antora/antora --cache-dir=./.cache/antora antora-playbook.yml An alternate approach is to override the HOME directory of the container user: docs-site $ docker run -u $(id -u) -e HOME=/antora -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml In both cases, all files either cached or generated by Antora are neatly contained inside the mounted directory and owned by the current user. This configuration also has the benefit that the cache will be preserved between runs, so it’s a good idea to use regardless. If you want to shell into the container instead of having it run the antora command, append the name of the shell (ash) to the container run command: docs-site $ docker run -u $(id -u) -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -it antora/antora ash Now you can run the antora command from anywhere inside the running container. This mode is useful to use while editing. Since the container continues to run, you can quickly execute the antora command. If the base Antora image doesn’t include everything you need for your site, you can extend it. You can use this image as a base for your own Docker image. The image comes preconfigured with Yarn so you can install additional extension libraries, such as Asciidoctor Kroki (asciidoctor-kroki) for adding diagram support to AsciiDoc. Clone the docker-antora repository and switch to it: ~ $ git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/docker-antora.git && cd \"$(basename $_ .git)\" Create a custom Dockerfile file named Dockerfile.custom. Populate the file with the following contents: Example 1. Dockerfile.custom FROM antora/antora RUN yarn global add asciidoctor-kroki (1) 1 Adds a custom extension to the base image. Build the image using the following command: docker-antora $ docker build -t local/antora:custom -f Dockerfile.custom . Once the build is finished, you’ll have a new image available on your machine named local/antora:custom. To see a list of all your images, run the following command: $ docker images To run this image, switch back to your playbook project and run the container as follows: docs-site $ docker run -u $(id -u) -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t local/antora:custom antora-playbook.yml If you want to share this image with others, you’ll need to publish it.

Asciidoctor 2 introduces many new features and a few substantive changes to existing features. The following sections describe the new behavior of existing Asciidoctor features and suggest the actions you should take prior to upgrading from Antora 2 to Antora 3. Feature New behavior Action Including non-AsciiDoc files using the include directive, particularly inside verbatim (listing, literal, or source) blocks Trailing space characters aren’t removed, tabs aren’t expanded, and newlines aren’t normalized when including a non-AsciiDoc file using the include directive. This can change how the output is displayed. Update non-AsciiDoc files that use a mix of tabs and spaces or inconsistent newlines if their content isn’t displaying as expected when published. Replace any tabs in non-AsciiDoc files if the indent attribute is set but not working as expected. Remove trailing space characters from non-AsciiDoc files, especially if using callouts in the file content or applying the indent attribute. Including non-AsciiDoc files with the indent attribute set on the include directive or verbatim block into which they’re inserted Since tabs aren’t expanded in the non-AsciiDoc content, the indent attribute may not work as expected. Including non-AsciiDoc files with callouts into a verbatim block using the include directive Since trailing spaces aren’t removed, callout numbers may no longer be detected. Feature New behavior Action Delimited listing blocks without an explicit style when source-language is set Delimited listing blocks (----) that don’t have an explicit style are automatically promoted to source blocks if source-language is set in the document, component descriptor, or playbook. This may result in unwanted syntax highlighting. If source-language isn’t set, you don’t need to take any action. If source-language is set, do the following: Assign the style listing to any unstyled delimited listing blocks that shouldn’t be promoted to source blocks. You can also change them to delimited literal blocks (....). (optional) Remove the style source from delimited listing blocks that should be promoted to source blocks. The source style is applied automatically. See Source Blocks to learn more. Source blocks that aren’t assigned a language The language none is automatically assigned to source blocks (source) when no language is set on the block or by source-language. The block is styled like other source blocks, but no syntax highlighting is applied. If this behavior is acceptable, no change is needed. Otherwise, do one of the following: assign the appropriate language to the source block, or remove the source style and replace it with the listing style, or remove the source style and change the block to a delimited literal block (....). See Source Blocks to learn more. Feature New behavior Action a and l column modifiers Normal substitutions and default header formatting are now correctly applied to the cells in an implicit header row when the AsciiDoc (a) and literal (l) modifiers are applied to the columns in a table. Update tables that use the a and l modifiers in combination with an implicit header row so your desired output is displayed. v modifier The verse modifier (v) is deprecated. Columns or cells assigned the v modifier are now treated as regular table cells. No action is needed if it’s acceptable for the cell content to be displayed as regular content. table-topbot CSS class The CSS class table-ends replaces the deprecated table-topbot CSS class. If you customized the styles for table-topbot in your UI, update the class name to table-ends and build a new UI bundle version. Table column width The rounding used when calculating table column widths changed minutely. No action is needed as the change shouldn’t be noticeable to site visitors. Feature New behavior Action Description list delimiters (::) Description list delimiters, that is, double colons (::) that are bare or at the start of line are no longer mistaken for a description list item. Remove escape syntax around double colons (::) that were previously mistaken for description list delimiters. Feature New behavior Action Section and block title substitution order The order of substitutions applied to section and block titles now matches the normal substitution order. This can affect section and block titles that use attribute references. Review section and block titles that contain attribute references for errors. Feature New behavior Action “Unresolved include directive” message in the content The message has changed to “Unresolved directive”. No action unless you’re using a postprocessor that looks for this message in the output. page class The class page for xrefs has been replaced with xref , where is the name of the family of the resource to which the xref points (e.g., xref page). You will need to update the selector in your CSS or postprocessor if it attempts to match this class. You can now find all xref links in the page using the CSS selector a.xref. page unresolved class The class page unresolved has been replaced with xref unresolved when the target of an xref is invalid or could not be resolved. You will need to update the selector in your CSS or postprocessor if it attempts to match this class. Reference validation for inline anchor If Asciidoctor cannot locate a reference to an inline anchor, even if it exists, it will log a message at the info level about a possible invalid reference. Define inline anchors using the double square bracket enclosure, and only place them in locations where Asciidoctor scans for them. Valid locations include anywhere in paragraph text or at the start of a list item or table cell. You could also ignore these messages or not enable the info log level. attribute-missing The attribute-missing setting is now honored when include directives and block macros are processed. This may reveal new missing include files and references. Check the log messages for new warnings and fix any reported errors. Feature New behavior Action Footnote macro The footnoteref macro is deprecated and the structure of the footnote macro has changed to be consistent with other AsciiDoc macros. Previously, the footnote target was placed inside the macro’s square brackets. Now the target is placed directly after the colon (footnote:[]). Change footnoteref to footnote and move the footnote target to the correct position. Anchors and xrefs in footnotes Anchor and xref macros are processed before footnote macros so that footnote macros aren’t terminated prematurely. Remove escape syntax, such as a backslash (\\), from anchor and xref macros used inside footnote macro attribute lists. Feature New behavior Action \"\" quote block delimiter The 2-character \"\" quote block delimiter is deprecated. Remove the deprecated \"\" delimiters and replace with the quote block style with the four underscores (____) block delimiters or quote paragraph syntax. Feature New behavior Action Encode characters in email address to comply with RFC-3986 Previously, spaces in an email address were encoded as %20. Now, spaces are encoded as a plus sign (+) in email addresses to comply with RFC-3986. This change will not affect the behavior of email links. Starting with Asciidoctor 2.0.0, Asciidoctor and Asciidoctor.js switched to semantic versioning. This allows Antora to automatically pick up the latest patch versions of Asciidoctor.js during installation without having to make a new Antora release available.

Antora classifies source files stored in an attachments directory as attachments. 3 An attachment source file. The attachments directory is optional. Antora applies preset behavior to the files stored in an attachments directory when it generates a site. An attachment is typically a file a site visitor views or downloads using their browser, such as a PDF or the ZIP archive of a sample project. At runtime, Antora automatically: Loads each file from an attachments directory into the Antora content catalog, except for files marked as hidden or missing a file extension Assigns each loaded attachment file to the attachment family Assigns each loaded attachment a unique resource ID for source-to-source referencing Publishes each loaded attachment file as an individual page in a site, except for files marked as unpublished Using an attachment’s resource ID, you can cross reference an attachment from other pages, resources, or navigation files in your site.

Attributes that are defined in a component version descriptor are referred to as component version attributes. Component version attributes can be built-in, custom, and page attributes. These attributes are applied and available (or made unavailable if unset) to all of a component version’s pages according to the attribute precedence rules. If an attribute was previously hard set or hard unset in the site’s playbook, its declaration in a component version descriptor will have no impact. Playbook file versus component version descriptor file Attributes are declared using the same structure and syntax in both the playbook file and the component version descriptor file. The playbook is where you configure the site, content sources, and UI URLs. A playbook file usually has the word playbook in its filename, e.g., antora-playbook.yml or local-antora-playbook.yml. A component version descriptor is where you configure the name, version, metadata, attributes, and navigation list of a component version. A component version descriptor’s filename is always antora.yml. For extension writers. If no AsciiDoc attributes are defined in the component descriptor, the asciidoc property on the component version object will reference the site-wide AsciiDoc config object (i.e., siteAsciiDocConfig). If you plan to modify component version attributes, first check if the value of the asciidoc property matches (===) the site-wide object and make a deep copy of it if so. Component version attributes are set in a component version’s antora.yml file. First, the asciidoc and attributes keys must be set. Then, each component version attribute is entered on its own line as a key-value pair under attributes. Example 1. Declare attributes in antora.yml name: light title: Data Light version: '2.3' asciidoc: (1) attributes: (2) table-caption: Data Set (3) hide-uri-scheme: '' (4) page-level: Advanced (5) page-category: Statistics; Cloud Infrastructure (6) nav: - modules/ROOT/nav.adoc 1 On a new line, type asciidoc, followed by a colon (:), and press Enter. 2 Nest the attributes key on the line directly underneath the asciidoc key. Type attributes, followed by a colon (:), and press Enter. 3 Each component version attribute is nested under the attributes key and defined on its own line. Type the name of the attribute, followed by a colon (:). Press the spacebar once after the colon, then type the value of the attribute. 4 To set an attribute without specifying an explicit value, assign an empty string by entering two consecutive single quotation marks ('') in the value part. For certain built-in attributes, an empty value is equivalent to the default value, though it depends on the attribute. Although using the boolean value true often works in this case, attribute values in AsciiDoc are strings, so it will likely be coerced to the string value 'true'. 5 To declare a custom page attribute, type page- and the name of your attribute, followed by a colon (:). Press spacebar once after the colon, then enter the value of the attribute. 6 When an attribute has multiple, independent values, separate each value with a semicolon (;). A set component version attribute is applied and available to every page that belongs to the component version. The values of custom attributes, such as page-level, can be displayed in a page using the attribute reference syntax (e.g., {page-level}). The attributes in Example 1 are all hard set. Hard set component version attributes cannot be overridden from a page. By default, an attribute is hard set when it’s assigned a value that isn’t reserved for unsetting the attribute (i.e., false or ~) and doesn’t end with a modifier (i.e., @). To allow a page to modify or unset a component version attribute, you need to soft set the component version attribute. Soft set component version attributes can be overridden from a page. An attribute is soft set by attaching the @ modifier to the end of its value. Example 2. Assign soft set precedence to attributes asciidoc: attributes: table-caption: Data Set@ (1) hide-uri-scheme: '@' (2) 1 To soft set an attribute that’s assigned an explicit value, attach the @ modifier to the end of its value. 2 To soft set and assign a built-in attribute’s default value, or in the case of a boolean attribute, the empty string value, type an opening single quotation mark, followed by the @ modifier, and then a closing single quotation mark ('). Since the component version attributes in Example 2 are soft set, a page could modify their values or unset them. The value of any component version attribute set earlier in the same antora.yml file or the value of any site attribute can be inserted into the value of a component version attribute using an AsciiDoc attribute reference (e.g., {site-title}, {page-level}). Example 3. A component version attribute that references the value of another component version attribute name: light title: Data Light version: '2.3' asciidoc: attributes: table-caption: Data Set url-plugins: https://example.com/plugins url-data-plugin: {url-plugins}/data-light nav: - modules/ROOT/nav.adoc A component version attribute can also be referenced in the value of a page attribute. To prevent an attribute reference substitution in an attribute value, insert a backslash in front of the reference (e.g., \\{not-substituted}). In this case, the attribute reference will not be substituted and the backslash will be omitted. Attributes can also be unset. Component version attributes are hard unset when they’re assigned the reserved tilde symbol (~) value. Each attribute is entered on its own line as a key-value pair under the attributes key. Example 4. Hard unset attributes asciidoc: attributes: table-caption: ~ (1) hide-uri-scheme: ~ (2) 1 To hard unset an attribute, assign it the tilde symbol (~). ~ is shorthand in YAML for nil, which is a reserved value that hard unsets a site attribute. 2 Boolean attributes are also hard unset when assigned the tilde symbol (~). Hard unset component version attributes cannot be overridden from a page. When a component version attribute is hard unset, its behavior is turned off and it isn’t available to the component version’s pages. Soft unset component version attributes can be overridden from a page. An attribute is soft unset by assigning it the reserved value false. Example 5. Assign soft unset precedence to attributes asciidoc: attributes: table-caption: false (1) hide-uri-scheme: false (2) 1 To soft unset an attribute, assign it the value false. 2 Boolean attributes are also soft unset when assigned false. Since the attributes in Example 5 are soft unset, a page could reset them. Antora takes the precedence assigned to site attributes into account first. An attribute declared in an antora.yml file cannot override the same attribute if it’s hard set or hard unset in a playbook. A component version attribute can override a site attribute only if the site attribute is soft set or unset. When component version attributes are declared, you can control whether a page can reset or unset each attribute on a case by case basis. Assuming that the attribute was soft set or unset, or wasn’t previously defined in a playbook, then component version attributes that are hard set or hard unset can’t be changed by a page. However, soft set and unset component version attributes can be overridden from a page. Hard setting a component version attribute using a string value with no trailing @ modifier (e.g., value or '') prevents a page from changing or unsetting the attribute. Soft setting a component version attribute using a string value with a trailing @ modifier (e.g., value@ or '@') allows a page to change or unset the attribute. Hard unsetting a component version attribute using the tilde symbol (~) prevents a page from setting the attribute. Soft unsetting a component version attribute using a false value allows a page to set the attribute. To learn more about how component version attributes interact with site attributes and page attributes, see Assign Attributes to a Site and AsciiDoc Attributes in Antora. Antora defines intrinsic page attributes from most of the keys in a component version descriptor file. For instance, Antora sets the built-in attribute page-component-title and assigns it the value specified by the title key. These attributes cannot be referenced by other attributes defined in antora.yml, but can be referenced in any page within the same component version. See Intrinsic page attributes for a complete list of the page attributes Antora automatically declares. Antora also sets some built-in AsciiDoc attributes, such as sectanchors, by default. See Site and configuration attributes for more information. Some built-in AsciiDoc attributes are not applicable in the Antora environment. These attributes include data-uri, allow-uri-read, docinfo, linkcss, noheader, nofooter, webfonts, and outfilesuffix. Setting these attributes either has no effect or may cause Antora to malfunction. Other attributes, such as imagesdir, are automatically set by Antora and cannot be overridden.","title":"Assign Attributes to a Component Version","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"component-attributes","url":"/antora/3.1/component-attributes.html","titles":[{"text":"Component version attributes","hash":"component-version-attributes","id":1},{"text":"Set attributes in antora.yml","hash":"hard-set","id":2},{"text":"Soft set attributes","hash":"soft-set","id":3},{"text":"Insert the value of another attribute","hash":"references-in-values","id":4},{"text":"Unset attributes in antora.yml","hash":"hard-unset","id":5},{"text":"Soft unset attributes","hash":"soft-unset","id":6},{"text":"Precedence rules","hash":"precedence-rules","id":7},{"text":"Intrinsic component version attributes","hash":"intrinsic","id":8}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"The display_version key is strictly used for presentation purposes in the reference UI when a version identifier contains uppercase letters, symbols, or blank spaces. It doesn’t affect resource IDs, the version segment in the publishable resource URLs, or how component versions are sorted. The display_version key is optional. It’s set in a component version’s antora.yml file and used by the reference UI where ever the version is displayed, including the component version selector and page version selector. If display_version isn’t set, the reference UI falls back to the version key. Unlike version, the value of display_version can contain spaces, uppercase letters, and most characters (e.g., 3.0 Beta, RED WREN!, rawhide). Example 1. antora.yml name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '5.6' display_version: '5.6 EOL' (1) 1 If the value starts with a number, enclose it in a set of single quote marks ('). The display_version key should be used when a version contains spaces or characters that would break Antora’s resource IDs, prevent portability between web servers, and aren’t recommended in URLs. It’s useful when the component version is a prerelease, unversioned, or archived because the value of display_version doesn’t affect publishable resource URLs and resource IDs. The prerelease key provides additional UI routing, sorting, and presentation capabilities. While the value of the display_version key is shown in the UI when both keys are set, the computed prerelease version generated from a prerelease identifier is used for sorting and routing. To learn more about how Antora uses the display_version key and compare it to the other version facets—​actual version, prerelease version, and symbolic version—​see Version Facets. Let’s expand on the antora.yml example where you previously learned how to assign a component name and version. The Silver Leaf project team wants the version code name in addition to its version number to be displayed in the UI. Since version can’t contain blank spaces, let’s set display_version in the component version’s antora.yml file. Open the component version’s antora.yml file in the text editor or IDE of your choice. Example 2. antora.yml for the component version silver-leaf 7.1 name: silver-leaf title: Silver Leaf version: '7.1' On a new line, type display_version, directly followed by a colon (:). Insert a blank space after the colon, and then type the value you want to assign to display_version. Since the value begins with a number, enclose it in a set of single quote marks ('). name: silver-leaf title: Silver Leaf version: '7.1' display_version: '7.1 Spiny' Save the file. Now, the UI will display 7.1 Spiny in the component version selector and page version selector.","title":"Customize the Display Version","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"component-display-version","url":"/antora/3.1/component-display-version.html","titles":[{"text":"display_version key","hash":"display-version-key","id":1},{"text":"Assign a display_version to a component version","hash":"assign-display-version","id":2}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: The requirements an antora.yml file must meet. How to assign a valid value to the name key. How to assign a valid value to the version key. How to define additional keys and values in an antora.yml file. You understand what a component version is and the purpose of antora.yml. A component version descriptor file must: be named antora.yml be written in valid YAML contain the name key with a valid value contain the version key (unless inherited from the content source in the playbook) with a valid value be stored at the same directory level as the modules directory The following section provides instructions for creating an antora.yml file and assigning values to the name and version keys to define a component version. For detailed information about the purpose of name and version, how Antora uses them, their specific requirements, and more usage examples, see Name Key and Version Key. Let’s create an antora.yml file that defines the name and version of a component version. In this exercise, we’ll create a component version for the project Silver Leaf. Its component name will be silver-leaf, and its version will be 7.1. Open a new file in your text editor or IDE. On the first line, type name, directly followed by a colon (:). Press the Spacebar to insert a space after the colon, and then type the value you want to assign to name. The name key doesn’t accept certain characters or spaces in its value, see name requirements for details. name: silver-leaf At the end of the value, press Enter to go to the next line. Type version, directly followed by a colon (:), and then press the Spacebar to insert a space. Type the value you want to assign to version. In this example, the value is enclosed in a set of single quote marks (') so it’s not interpreted as a number. name: silver-leaf version: '7.1' The version key doesn’t accept certain characters or spaces in its value, see version requirements for details. Save the file as antora.yml in the content source root. The antora.yml file should be located adjacent to the modules directory, which contains the content files for the component version. You’ve now associated a set of source files with a component version! When Antora runs, all of the source files stored in the standard set of directories will be assigned the component name silver-leaf and the version 7.1. These values will be used as resource ID coordinates and in the URLs of the publishable resources generated from the component version’s source files. Be sure to always use the same case when declaring the component name if you’re defining multiple versions of a component. If the case differs (e.g., Silver-Leaf versus silver-leaf), Antora will treat these as different components. See Name Key and Version Key for more examples and value requirements. You can assign additional metadata, designate a component version as a prerelease, apply AsciiDoc attributes, and register a component version’s navigation list and start page using the component version descriptor. Optional Key Description asciidoc.attributes The asciidoc key accepts the attributes key and its nested list of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs listed under attributes represent built-in and user-defined AsciiDoc attributes (e.g., idseparator: '-') and page attributes. Attributes in antora.yml are applied to all of the pages and resources (where applicable) that belong to a component version. display_version Version identifier used for presentation purposes only in the reference UI’s component version selector and page version selector. display_version accepts empty spaces, uppercase letters, and most characters (e.g., 3.0 Beta, RED WREN!). nav Accepts a list of navigation files. Navigation files (e.g., nav.adoc) that are registered under the nav key are used in the component version’s page menu. prerelease Designates a component version as a prerelease version and deactivates the default routing rules. Key can append a prerelease identifier (e.g., -alpha.2) to version without affecting the version coordinate or version URL segment. start_page Specifies a page as the component version’s home page. By default, Antora uses index.adoc in a component version’s ROOT module. title Component name used for sorting and presentation purposes only in the reference UI’s component version page menu, component version selector, and page breadcrumbs. Accepts empty spaces, uppercase letters, and a broad range of characters (e.g., API Manager).

A component name, also called name, is the value assigned to the name key in a component version descriptor file (antora.yml). A component name typically represents the name of a project, library, service, etc., such as fauna, rudder, nrepl, etc. The value of a name key, in combination with the value of a version key, defines a component version. The component name is fundamental to many of Antora’s operations. Antora uses the name: as the component segment in page and asset URLs, unless the name of the component is ROOT. Additionally, if the component title key isn’t set, Antora uses the name: to sort component versions for display purposes in the reference UI, which includes the component version page menu, component version selector menu, and the first breadcrumb position on a component version’s pages Note that component name is case sensitive. This means that if you have two components with the same name that only are different in case, Antora will treat them as different components. Content writers use the name as the component coordinate in resource IDs when referencing a resource in another documentation component. The name key is required. It’s set and assigned a value in a component version descriptor file (antora.yml). Example 1. antora.yml with defined component name name: colorado (1) 1 At the beginning of a new line, type name, directly followed by a colon and a space (: ). Then type the value you want assigned to name. The value assigned to the name key can contain letters, numbers, underscores (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.). To ensure portability between host platforms, letters used in the name value should be lowercase. We strongly encourage you to select a name that only consists of lowercase characters. Component names, except for the special ROOT value, are used in your site’s URLs, therefore, using consistent casing makes the component name, and thus your site, more portable. That’s because some file systems, and thus the web server running on it, can’t distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters. The value cannot contain spaces, forward slashes (/), or HTML special characters (&, ). The value cannot be empty. See Customize the Title to learn how to display a name that contains spaces, uppercase letters, and other characters in your site’s UI. When a component’s name is set to ROOT and its version is set to ~ in its antora.yml, then that component will be placed directly at the site’s root. It will not be placed inside a folder named ROOT. This is analogous to how modules named ROOT are placed at the root of their component. Like other components, a ROOT component must have an antora.yml file and a modules folder. Let’s re-use the example from Module Segment in Page URLs: 📒 repository 📄 antora.yml # name: ROOT and version: ~ 📂 modules 📂 admin 📂 pages 📄 user-management.adoc 📄 nav.adoc 📂 ROOT 📁 images 📂 pages 📄 deploy.adoc 📄 index.adoc 📄 nav.adoc But now let’s instead assume that this component is named ROOT instead of hyperlemur, and its version set to ~. Here is what the URLs of the pages would be (assuming that html_extension_style is set to default in your playbook): repository/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc https://my-company.com/index.html (which means it will also be found at https://my-company.com) repository/modules/ROOT/pages/deploy.adoc https://my-company.com/deploy.html repository/modules/admin/pages/user-management.adoc https://my-company.com/admin/user-management.html Because both the component name ROOT and the module name ROOT are excluded from URLs, the pages in the ROOT component’s ROOT module live directly at your site’s root, with root_component/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc serving as the site’s home page. That means that the index.adoc page in the ROOT module of the ROOT component acts as the site start page without having to specify it (no additional configuration is required). If the ROOT component were to be versioned (i.e., have a non-empty version), then the files in that component version would be placed inside the version folder at the root of the site. Because the ROOT component’s name does not appear in URLs, its modules are effectively scoped under your site’s root. This means it’s possible for pages in the ROOT component to conflict with pages in a named component. For instance, the file modules/xyz/pages/index.adoc in the (unversioned) ROOT component and the file modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc in the (unversioned) xyz component will both resolve to the URL https://my-company.com/xyz/index.html, which is invalid. Therefore, you should be mindful of this situation when using modules in the ROOT component. Since ROOT is not a user-friendly title for a component, you should also set the title in antora.yml, as demonstrated in Customize the Title.","title":"Name Key","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"component-name-key","url":"/antora/3.1/component-name-key.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s a component name?","hash":"whats-a-component-name","id":1},{"text":"How Antora uses name","hash":"usage","id":2},{"text":"name key","hash":"key","id":3},{"text":"name requirements","hash":"requirements","id":4},{"text":"ROOT component","hash":"root-component","id":5}]},"38":{"id":38,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: How to register navigation files with the nav key in antora.yml.

Each value specifies the path to a navigation file (e.g., modules/module-directory/nav-file.adoc) relative to antora.yml. Example 1. antora.yml that registers two navigation files name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '5.6' nav: (1) - modules/get-started/nav.adoc (2) - modules/ROOT/nav.adoc (3) 1 The nav key must be entered on its own line and be directly followed by a colon (:). 2 Value registering a navigation file located in the get-started module directory. 3 Value registering a navigation file located in the ROOT module directory.

The prerelease key is optional. A component version is identified as a prerelease when the prerelease key is assigned a user-defined identifier, such as -beta.2, or the boolean value true. Antora doesn’t apply the default routing rules to a component version designated as a prerelease, even if it’s the latest version in that docs component (unless all versions of that docs component are prereleases). When a component version is ready to graduate from a prerelease to a stable release, change the value of the prerelease key to false or delete the key and its value from the antora.yml file. To learn more about the capabilities the prerelease key provides and compare it to the other version facets—​actual version, display version, and symbolic version—​see Version Facets. A component version becomes a prerelease when the prerelease key is set in antora.yml and assigned an identifier. An identifier is a user-defined, non-empty string such as .alpha.2, -M1, SNAPSHOT, and -rc.5. It can contain uppercase letters and a broad range of characters. The component version defined in Example 1 is a prerelease. Example 1. antora.yml with prerelease assigned the identifier -rc.3 name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '6.0.0' prerelease: -rc.3 (1) 1 Assign an identifier to prerelease to designate the component version as a prerelease. When prerelease is assigned an identifier, Antora computes an internal prerelease version value for UI sorting and, if display_version isn’t set, for display purposes. This computed prerelease version depends on the first character in the prerelease identifier. Identifiers that begin with a hyphen (-) or dot (.) The computed prerelease version takes the form of version-identifier or version.identifier. Antora directly appends the prerelease identifier to the version key’s value to compute the prerelease version. For instance, using Example 1, the computed prerelease version would be 6.0.0-rc.3. Identifiers that begin with any other valid character The computed prerelease version takes the form of version identifier. Antora separates the identifier from the version key’s value with one blank space to compute the prerelease version. Example 2. antora.yml with prerelease assigned the identifier Beta name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '4.0' prerelease: Beta Using Example 2, the computed prerelease version would be 4.0 Beta. Unless the display_version key is set in antora.yml, Antora assigns the computed prerelease version to display_version at runtime. If display_version is defined in antora.yml, then that value is displayed in the UI. However, the component version is still sorted according to the internally computed prerelease version value. A component version becomes a prerelease when the prerelease key is set in antora.yml and assigned the value true. Example 3. antora.yml with prerelease defined as true name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '6.5.0-snapshot' prerelease: true When prerelease is true, the component version is sorted by the value of version but the default routing rules aren’t applied to it even if it’s the latest version in that docs component. Prerelease versions are skipped when Antora selects the latest version of a docs component unless all component versions are prereleases, in which case the default rules apply. They’re sorted according to the versioning scheme criteria the computed prerelease version meets. When a component version is ready to graduate from a prerelease to a stable release, change the value of the prerelease key to false. Example 4. antora.yml with prerelease defined as false name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '6.0.0' prerelease: false (1) 1 Remove the previous value and replace it with false to promote the component version to a stable release.

This page can either be the default start page or a page identified by the component version descriptor. Visitors land on a component version’s start page when they click on its entry in the component version selector and when they click on its name at the top of the page menu. The start page for a component version is separate from the start page for a site. The start page for a site is where the visitor is directed when they go to the site’s main URL. To configure your site’s start page, see Site Start Page. By default, Antora looks for a page named index.adoc in the ROOT module of a component version and uses it as the component version’s start page (e.g., https://site-url.org/component-name/version/index.html). If Antora doesn’t find this page, visitors are directed to a 404 page every time they click on the component version from the component version selector or page menu. If you set the start_page key in the component version’s antora.yml, Antora will use that page as the start page instead of the index.adoc page in the ROOT module. You only have the set the start_page key if you want to use an alternate page than the default as the start page. The start_page key must be set in antora.yml when: a component version doesn’t have a page named index.adoc in its ROOT module, or when Antora should use an alternate page (that is, not index.adoc, even if it exists) as the component version’s start page. The start_page key accepts the resource ID of a page that belongs to the component version the antora.yml file describes. The resource ID must start from the module coordinate (though the ROOT module is implied if not present). Example 1. antora.yml name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '5.6' start_page: get-started:overview.adoc In Example 1, the component version’s start page, overview.adoc, is located in the module get-started.

The title key is optional. This key is set in a component version’s antora.yml file. The value is used by the reference UI wherever the component or component version is referenced, including the component version page menu, component version selector, and first breadcrumb position on a component version’s pages. Although the title is set per component version, it should almost always be uniform across all versions of a component. Antora uses the title of the latest version as the title of the component. When viewing a specific version, such as in the breadcrumb navigation, the title of that version will be displayed instead. If the title differs between versions, it may confuse the reader. If you do need to change the title in a newer version, and you don’t want to update older versions, you can customize the UI template to always use the title of the latest version. If title isn’t set, the reference UI uses the component name (the value of the name key) instead. Unlike name, the value of title can contain spaces, uppercase letters, and a broader range of characters (e.g., SUSE Manager, APIkit). Example 1. antora.yml name: colorado title: Colorado ∆ version: '5.6' This key is useful when a project’s name contains spaces or characters that break Antora’s page and resource IDs, prevent portability between web servers, or aren’t recommended in URLs. Also, if the name of your project changes, you can change the value of the title key but not have to update page and resource IDs or redirect URLs. Let’s expand on the antora.yml example where you previously learned how to assign a component name and version.

The presence of an antora.yml file at a content source root signals to Antora that it should find a sibling modules directory that contains source files that belong to a component version. The antora.yml file at a content source root provides the required and optional component version metadata that Antora assigns to the source files it collects from the standard directories located in the modules folder. Starting at each content source root, Antora looks for an antora.yml file. When it finds antora.yml, it searches for a sibling modules directory and considers all of its subdirectories and files to be part of a component version. If Antora doesn’t find antora.yml at a content source root, it doesn’t look for a modules directory or collect any files from that location. This minimizes the chances of Antora wasting memory and CPU time to process source files that aren’t part of a documentation site. The antora.yml files provide the ability to store your content source files anywhere in a directory hierarchy. As long as the content source root contains an antora.yml file, you can maintain and manage your content source files in a repository that also stores application code, tests, and other materials. An antora.yml file is referred to as a component version descriptor because it provides required and optional information that identifies, describes, and configures a component version. In turn, this metadata and configuration is applied to all of the source files that belong to the component version. This is why Antora can collect files from multiple repositories, directories, branches, and tags, and compile them into a single component version. Instead of processing files based on their file system or repository location, Antora converts files based on the information assigned to the source files by a component version descriptor file. An antora.yml file contains the following required keys: Required Key Description name Component name used with version to identify a component version. Used as the component coordinate in resource IDs and in the component URL segment for a component version’s published resources. version Version used with name to identify a component version. Used as the version coordinate in resource IDs and as the version segment for a component version’s published resource URLs, except when a component version is defined as unversioned. Specifying the version key in a component version descriptor file is optional if the value of the key is inherited from the content source in the playbook. You can specify the version key on the content source if you want the value to be automatically derived from the refname or based on a refname mapping. An antora.yml file can also contain any of the following optional keys: Optional Key Description asciidoc.attributes The asciidoc key accepts the attributes key and its nested list of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs listed under attributes represent built-in and user-defined AsciiDoc attributes (e.g., idseparator: '-') and page attributes.

It’s important to understand how Antora uses the version and its related facets before committing to a versioning scheme. In Antora, a version is the value resolved from the version key in a component version descriptor file (antora.yml) or inherited from the content source in the playbook. A version is a semantic or named identifier that represents a unique release or instance of the documentation for a project. The resolved value of the version key, in combination with the value of the name key, defines a component version. Although the version is typically a literal value, it can also be interpreted. The version can be defined as unversioned by assigning a tilde, ~, to the version key. The version can be configured as the refname in which it resides by assigning true to the version key. The version can also be derived from the refname by assigning a map of refname projections to the version key. Occasionally, the value assigned to the version key is referred to as the actual version in this documentation when a distinction between version and the other version facets—​prerelease, display, and symbolic—needs to be made in a description or example. The version is fundamental to many of Antora’s operations. Antora uses the version: to sort component versions identify the latest version of a component apply routing rules as the version segment in publishable resource URLs, except when: the assigned value is the tilde (~) that defines an unversioned component version a component version is identified as the latest stable or latest prerelease version and the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key is set in the playbook for display purposes in the reference UI component version selector and page version selector menus, except when: the display_version key is set and assigned a value in the component version’s antora.yml file the display_version key is set by Antora at runtime because the prerelease key is assigned an identifier Content writers use the version as the version coordinate in resource IDs when referencing a resource in another component version. The version key accepts a named identifier, such as jesse, a semantic identifier, such as '1.5.0', the reserved value true, a map of refname projections, such as v/(?*): $, or the reserved value ~. The ~ values defines a component version as unversioned. To learn how to specify an unversioned component version, see Define a Component with No Version. If the version key is defined in the component version descriptor file for a component version, it takes precedence over a value defined on the content source in the playbook. If you prefer the playbook to control the value of the version key, don’t set the version key in the component version descriptor file. The following example shows how to assign a named identifier to the version key. Example 1. antora.yml with named identifier assigned to version name: star version: rigel (1) 1 On a new line, type version, directly followed by a colon and a space (: ). Then type the value you want assigned to version. A semantic identifier is either an integer or begins with an integer and contains at least one dot (.). 10, 1.0.0, and 5.1 are all examples of semantic identifiers. Although a semantic identifier looks like a number, it’s actually a string. If the semantic identifier matches the syntax of a number (integer or decimal), like the one shown in Example 2, you should enclose the value in a pair of single quotes ('), which coerces it to a string. The following example shows how to assign a semantic identifier to the version key. Example 2. antora.yml with semantic identifier assigned to version name: colorado version: '5.6.0' (1) 1 Enclose a value that matches the syntax of a number in a pair of single quote marks ('). Antora recognizes semantic identifiers according to semantic versioning rules. Semantic versioning is often referred to as semver. Antora allows a semantic identifier to begin with v. Although this prefix is preserved in the value, Antora will ignore it when sorting versions. For example, v9.0.2 will be sorted as though the value is 9.0.2. Since content in Antora is retrieved from a git repository, you may want to use the git refname (branch or tag name) in which the component version descriptor is stored as the version. To do so, assign the reserved value true to the version, as shown in Example 3. Example 3. antora.yml with true assigned to version name: colorado version: true (1) 1 The value true tells Antora to use the refname as the value. Antora will substitute the value true with the refname automatically. The value Antora uses is always the short refname (e.g., v1.0), not the full refname (e.g., refs/heads/v1.0). The refname may not be granular enough to use as the version. Furthermore, the same git tree could be passed through git references that have different naming schemes, such as feature branches. In these cases, you want the version to be extracted or derived from the refname rather than using the value as is. That’s when you’d define the version using a refname projection. A refname projection is expressed as a map of patterns (the keys) and replacements (the values). The refname projection allows you to match the refname using a pattern, then build a version based on that match. The pattern tells Antora which entry to use and what parts to extract from it. The replacement tells Antora how to derive a version from the matched refname. The following example shows how to use a projection to compute the value of the version key from the refname. Example 4. antora.yml with version computed from a refname projection name: colorado version: v(?+({0..9}).+({0..9})).x: $ (1) feature/(*)/*: $1 (2) 1 Matches the semantic identifier in a refname like v2.0.x and extracts it 2 Extracts the value between the first and second slash for a refname that begins with feature/ The key in the projection is a glob pattern (a combination of extglobs, ranges, and some regex constructs). The pattern has the same matching capabilities as the pattern used to match branches or tags for a content source in the playbook. The characters between parentheses (i.e., round brackets) in the pattern defines a match group. If the opening brace begins with ?, that group is assigned to the name specified between the angle brackets. Otherwise, the group is assigned to a 1-based index according to the group’s position in the pattern. The match groups can be referenced in the replacement. A match group reference is preceded by a dollar sign ($). A named group can be referenced using $, where the name is once again specified between the angle brackets. An indexed group can be referenced by its number, such as $1. You can reference the entire refname using $&. If the match group contains any forward slashes, Antora will replace each one with a hyphen. Antora will use the value of the first pattern it matches. If none of the patterns match the refname, Antora will fallback to using the refname as the version. A literal value assigned to the version key can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). To ensure portability between host platforms, letters used in the version value should be lowercase. The value cannot contain spaces, forward slashes (/), or HTML special characters (&, ). See Customize the Display Version to learn how to represent a version that contains spaces, uppercase letters, and other characters in the UI menus.","title":"Version Key","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"component-version-key","url":"/antora/3.1/component-version-key.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s a version?","hash":"whats-a-version","id":1},{"text":"How Antora uses version","hash":"usage","id":2},{"text":"version key","hash":"key","id":3},{"text":"Named identifier as version","hash":"named-identifier","id":4},{"text":"Semantic identifier as version","hash":"semver-identifier","id":5},{"text":"refname as version","hash":"refname","id":6},{"text":"refname projection as version","hash":"refname-projection","id":7},{"text":"Value requirements","hash":"requirements","id":8}]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"A component version represents a discrete version of the documentation for a project, product, library, service, training course, etc. Antora looks for source files associated with the same component name and version in multiple content sources and aggregates them together to make a component version.

For example, hosted technology services and team handbooks may only need their content to represent how the service or process works as of right now. This is where the reserved version value of a tilde, ~, comes into play. To define a component version that doesn’t have a version, assign a tilde, ~, to the version key. The ~ is shorthand for the value null, which has the same effect. Example 1. antora.yml for a versionless component version name: component-name version: ~ (1) 1 On a new line, type the key version, directly followed by a colon and a blank space (: ). Then enter the value ~. Antora doesn’t apply the same behavior and output rules to an unversioned component version that it does to a component version with a named or semantic version. For example, Antora doesn’t include the version segment in the publishable resource URLs of an unversioned component version (e.g., /component-name/module-name/page-name.html). The version key is required for a component version since versioning is central to how Antora works. The behavior and output rules that are influenced by the version are described in How Antora uses version. However, Antora accounts for the fact that some components aren’t versioned or have an unversioned version that’s co-located with actual versions. When the version key is assigned ~, defining the component version as unversioned, Antora: sorts the unversioned component version above other versions that belong to the same component identifies it as the latest version of a component or, if the prerelease key is set, as the latest prerelease version of a component assigns the fallback value default to the display_version key at runtime for display purposes in the UI menus, except when: the display_version key is assigned a value in antora.yml, or the prerelease key is assigned an identifier and the display_version key isn’t set in antora.yml; at runtime, Antora assigns the identifier to the display_version key doesn’t add a version segment to the unversioned component version’s publishable resource URLs, even if the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key is set in the playbook, unless the latest_version_segment_strategy is redirect:from UI and extension developers When a component version is defined as unversioned: the reserved version value, ~ or null, is coerced into and stored as an empty string internally a version segment isn’t added to pub.url or out.path Because an unversioned component version is often the only version or always the latest component version in a component, Antora automatically routes any incoming references that originate from other components that don’t specify a version coordinate to it. However, in rare cases, such as when referencing an unversioned prerelease from another component version, you can use the reserved keyword _ (an underscore) as the version coordinate in the resource ID (e.g., xref:_@component:module:file.adoc[]) to reference an unversioned component version.","title":"Define a Component with No Version","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"component-with-no-version","url":"/antora/3.1/component-with-no-version.html","titles":[{"text":"Assign ~ to the version key","hash":"assign-to-the-version-key","id":1},{"text":"Behavior and output","hash":"usage","id":2},{"text":"Reference an unversioned resource","hash":"reference-an-unversioned-resource","id":3}]},"46":{"id":46,"text":"Antora collects content source files from directories in branches, tags, and worktrees of git repositories. These source files are only retrieved and processed correctly if Antora can locate them within a content source root. The source files containing a site’s content are stored in one or more git repositories. These repositories can be remote, local, or a combination of both. In a playbook file, you’ll enter several parameters (e.g., url, branches, tags, and start paths) that: allow Antora to locate and connect to your content source repositories, and provide Antora with the location criteria that resolves to one or more content source roots within a git repository. If the repository is local, by default Antora will attempt to use the worktree of that repository if the current branch matches one of the branches defined on the content source. This behavior is configurable. Antora requires a local directory to be a git repository, which means the local directory is a git worktree. The git repository itself can be empty, meaning you don’t have to commit any files in order for it to work. If the local directory is not yet a git repository, you can make it one by running the following commands: $ git init . && git commit --allow-empty -m init Before configuring a site’s playbook, you’ll want to determine where to set up the content source roots in your repositories. A content source root is a location in a branch or tag (i.e., a reference) of a repository from where Antora begins looking for content source files. Think of the content source root as the entrance of the store where Antora shops. From the content source root, Antora looks for an antora.yml file, which identifies the component version bucket, then scans for a collection of source files organized in a standard set of directories to add to that bucket. A repository can have many content source roots. You may have one content source root per branch or tag. Or you may have multiple content source roots per branch or tag defined using multiple start paths. You can also have a combination of both. Where you store the content source roots is up to you.","title":"Repositories and Content Source Roots","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"content-source-repositories","url":"/antora/3.1/content-source-repositories.html","titles":[{"text":"git repositories and content sources","hash":"git-and-content-sources","id":1},{"text":"What’s a content source root?","hash":"content-source-root","id":2}]},"47":{"id":47,"text":"This page describes several methods you can use for managing versions of your content. While these recommendations are most applicable to software documentation, they can apply for other content as well. Using this method, you store each documentation version in a branch of a git repository, just like you use branches to store version lines of a software project. You then set the branches key on the content source to tell Antora which branches to use. The name of the branch itself does not matter. It’s the version key in the component version descriptor or playbook that determines the version. Using branches to version content is the method we recommend starting with when using Antora. Branches are ideally suited for managing multiple versions of the same content. If you haven’t used branches for versioning before, you may have stored versions in folders. If we were to use version folders to store documentation versions all in a single branch, then we’d have to explicitly copy all the files in a version to a new folder to create a new version. In doing so, we’d no longer be able to rely on git to compare, manage, and merge different versions of the same document. If we were to use tags to store documentation versions, then we wouldn’t be able to update the documentation once the tag was made, effectively freezing the documentation from receiving updates. Branches offer the right balance. By creating a new branch from an existing reference in the repository to hold a new version, the repository only stores what’s changed since that branch point. And that branch can receive updates at any time. That’s what git does best. Branches map well to the system of references provided by git and are flexible enough to allow documentation to be updated freely. Using this method, you store each documentation version in a tag of a git repository, just like you use tags to store software releases. You then set the tags key on the content source to tell Antora which tags to use. Tags provide many of the same benefits of branches, but with some notable downsides. Like branches, tags allow you to compare different instances of a file across versions and the repository only stores what’s changed since the previous tag point. The downside of tags is that, once created, you can’t update them like you can with branches. So, if you find a typo, or need to add an example, you can’t edit the content in a tag. It’s frozen. You’d have to delete and recreate the tag, or create a new tag and point to it, in order to publish your updates. If you decide to version content using tags, despite the drawbacks, we strongly recommend using dedicated tags for documentation (e.g., docs/2.0.1 to follow release/2.0.1). In doing so, you provide a window to update the documentation after the software tag is created and before the documentation for that software is frozen (by tagging it). Otherwise, you’d have to ensure all documentation updates are in before the software is released, which is rarely the case. (The alternative is to release the software so frequently that missing the software release is no big deal). Using this method, you store each documentation version in a folder in a single reference (branch or tag) of a repository. You then set the start_paths key on the content source to tell Antora which directories to consider to locate those folders and the branches or tags key to point Antora to the reference where the directories are located. The name of the folder itself does not matter. It’s the version key in the component version descriptor that determines the version. We generally recommend against using this method since you lose a lot of the advantages that git affords you, as previously described. However, it can be useful when the documentation for a lot of different versioned software components coexist in the same repository. In this scenario, references (branches or tags) don’t work well since a reference for a single software component will carry with it unrelated (and likely outdated) documentation from another software component. That kind of arrangement doesn’t fit with git’s model. And it can be confusing for writers. Using folders to version content is arguably the easiest system for the writer to use. The writer can clone the content source repository and immediately edit files across all versions without having to do any branch switching. Although the writer can no longer rely on git to compare, manage, and merge different versions, and each version starts as a complete copy of the previous one, the productivity benefits of having all the files together may win out. That’s why Antora supports this method. However, keep in mind that by using multiple worktrees, it’s possible to achieve a similar setup using branches that doesn’t sacrifice the ability to use git’s revision control mechanisms. You should only consider versioning content using folders if either the repository hosts versioned documentation for many different components or your writers are unable to work with branches. We view documentation as the explanation for the software in a release line. The documentation describes the software that has been published. Thus, it should be possible to update the documentation even after the software has been released (perhaps even long after). The documentation lifecycle isn’t bound to the software lifecycle, but rather follows it. In many cases, the documentation isn’t ready when the software release was made and still needs work (otherwise, you end up putting immense, often unreasonable, pressure on the documentation team). In other cases, new information is discovered about a software release that needs to be added to the documentation for that release. If the software adheres to semantic versioning, we generally recommend mapping the documentation version to the minor version of the software (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc.). This mapping is possible when the software is managed using branches that follow a minor release line (e.g., v1.0.x, v1.1.x, v2.0.x, etc.). Mapping the documentation version to a minor version line of the software works because, generally, documentation isn’t tied to patch releases. Often times, the documentation is updated to include information that was previously missed. And that information can be added at any time before or after the next patch release. In summary, we typically advise against building documentation for software releases from tags. Documentation is the explanation of the software, not the software itself. It needs to be possible to update documentation after a version of the software is frozen and released. If you do use tags, we strongly recommend using tags for documentation that are distinct from the tags for the software releases. Where tags fit well is when you’re publishing documentation for a prerelease. In a prerelease line, new features can be added well before the software is published. Those new features may be accompanied by documentation that describe those features. As a result, the documentation references features which are not yet available. If Antora publishes the documentation from the prerelease branch, the user can be misled into thinking certain features are available, when in fact they are not. To solve this problem, you can pull the documentation from the tag for the last prerelease instead. By publishing the documentation for a prerelease from a tag, you can lock the documentation to only what was available when the software was released. That way, you don’t publish documentation for features that aren’t yet available. The only caveat is that documentation which doesn’t make it in before the prerelease gets tagged won’t be available until the next prerelease—​the same limitation of using tags as previously described. However, it’s less of a concern in this case since a prerelease is, by it’s very nature, not considered complete and can be followed by other prereleases.

Antora can collect source files that belong to the same component version from multiple repositories. When a component version’s source files are stored in multiple content roots (i.e., multiple repositories, multiple start pages, etc), it’s referred to as a distributed component version. A common use case of a distributed component version is when most of its source files are stored in one repository, but a number of examples (examples family directory) and tutorials (pages family directory) are stored in another repository managed by a training team. Antora has no problem combining the source files from both storage locations into a single component version. This capability is provided by the simple, but-oh-so-powerful component version descriptor file, antora.yml. Recall that an antora.yml file specifies the component name and version of a component version. If Antora discovers two or more antora.yml files that specify an identical component name and version, it considers all of the files in the subsequent standard directory sets to belong to the same component version, even though the source files were collected from multiple locations. When the source files of a component version are distributed, only one of the antora.yml files should specify the optional configuration keys, such as title and nav, in addition to the required component name and version. All of the other antora.yml files that mark the locations of the component version’s source files must only specify the component name and version. Conflicting or duplicate optional configuration keys may produce unpredictable results. When setting up a distributed component version, each content source root must contribute a unique set of files (aside from antora.yml). In other words, the content source roots cannot overlap when combined. Antora will fail with an error if it finds two or more source files with same resource ID. These are identical filenames that belong to the same family and module in the distributed component version. This also occurs if Antora discovers a module that has two or more navigation files with identical filenames.

Example files usually contain content such as source code samples, terminal output, data sets, etc. When saving a new example file, keep the following filename requirements and recommendations in mind: An example’s filename can’t contain spaces because the AsciiDoc include directive doesn’t accept values with spaces. Uppercase letters aren’t recommended in filenames. Some file systems aren’t case sensitive. Therefore, file conflicts could occur depending on the file system a writer is using. Save an example file with a valid file extension except when it’s common industry practice for that specific file type, such as Dockerfile, to not have an extension. Not using the correct file extension when saving an example file may limit your ability to apply some Antora extensions or upgrade to future capabilities. An example file isn’t required to have a file extension. Unlike a publishable resource that’s treated as a hidden file if it’s missing a file extension, Antora will load an example that doesn’t have a file extension into its content catalog and assign the example a resource ID for referencing. Antora doesn’t publish example files as individual site pages. An example must be referenced by an include directive from a page, or resource that’s eventually included in a page, for the example’s content to be published.

Need to migrate your site to a different domain? Just rebuild the site and relaunch it on the new host. Antora generates sites that are static in the truest sense of the word. The site can be run on any web server, on any domain or subdomain, inside a subfolder, and even from the local file system. Adapt your site to fit seamlessly with your other web properties. No site is an island. Sites must play nice with others to maintain a consistent brand and user experiences. Static sites generated by Antora are well-suited for this role. With page templates and a little help from an automated process, you can blend your documentation pages into existing sites, giving the impression it’s all part of a single uniform site. Use a git-based CI workflow to manage documentation changes, contributions, and initiatives. Go where the development is. Whether it’s GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another code hosting service, you can tap into these platforms to develop Docs as Code. Not only does a git-based CI workflow give you collaboration and review tools for free, it also encourages collaboration to happen across teams. As a result, the docs become part of the software development process. And that means many more people feel ready to support the effort to improve the docs. Manage teams and permissions by leveraging existing development infrastructure. Chances are, your software product already has a well-defined team, permission structure, and contributor community. You can use the same organization or build on it to manage your docs team. These platforms can serve as an administrative and management interface for your docs, whether it’s to monitor activity or grant access to perform certain actions. Describe what you want to make and Antora takes it from there. Antora was built for writers first. Writers want to write, not fiddle with reconfiguring software. That’s where Antora’s playbook comes in. A playbook is a concise way to describe the site you want to produce. This description boils down to a) where to get the content, b) what UI to apply to the pages, and c) where to publish it. That’s all Antora needs to know to do its job. Only when you’re looking for additional customization do you need to dive deeper. Offline first. A site generated using Antora can be viewed entirely offline. All the references in the site are self-contained (i.e., relative), so you don’t need to run a web server to view it. Just open one of the generated HTML files in your browser and from there you can navigate to all the pages from the UI. Even redirects work offline by default. If a web server is available, you can pass additional configuration to tell Antora to take advantage of its capabilities. Use a single build to aggregate documentation that spans repository boundaries and branches. Most site generators are confined to a single branch of a single repository. Antora, on the other hand, knows how to speak git. It goes out and gathers up all the content the site needs using its built-in git client. It then sorts through the files by separating them into versions of components. This allows you to store the documentation in a way that works best for your organization, whether it means keeping content with code or using separate repositories. Antora can round up all those disparate projects and repositories and create an integrated site. Pick and choose content to handcraft your site. You won’t always want to include everything in the site. Sometimes, you just want to build a “microsite” that includes a reduced selection of products or versions. Or perhaps you just need to preview the documentation for the product you’re currently working on. The playbook lets you produce multiple variations of a site from the same content sources simply by tuning which sources you draw from. Build each version of the product as part of one site. Since software is versioned, the documentation for it needs to be versioned too. Otherwise, users won’t know which version of the software the documentation they’re reading covers. Confusion ensues. Like with software, you can use branches and tags to manage versions of the documentation. This content can even be stored with the software itself. Antora happily gathers all this content and organizes it so users can access each version of the documentation, all under a single site. Explore different product versions or navigate between pages across versions. With multiple versions of documentation available, the user needs a way to navigate to them. Antora provides a catalog of documentation components and versions that are presented to the reader as a menu. The reader can scan the menu and jump right to the version of the documentation they need. Additionally, each page can self identify as being part of a version sequence, allowing the user to quickly visit older or newer versions of the content on the page. Document using an intuitive syntax designed specifically for technical documentation that’s lightweight, yet comprehensive. When you write documentation, the last thing you want getting in your way is the markup syntax. To create the best content, you need to be able to see what you’re writing, but still be able to represent different content types appropriately. That’s exactly what AsciiDoc affords. Its line-oriented, left-aligned syntax is easy to browse and leaves room for applying just enough metadata to build a semantic structure. AsciiDoc is a documentation writer’s best friend. Keep your content DRY using reusable attributes, includes, and syntax extensions. Every time you type something you’ve typed before, you’re losing efficiency and introducing the risk of divergent content. AsciiDoc provides several tools to keep you from having to repeat yourself. You can use attributes to avoid having to type URLs, product names, or definitions multiple times. You can use includes to extract whole paragraphs, sections, and other reusable content to common files. And you can introduce extensions to the syntax to reduce commonly repeated patterns, such as references to an issue tracker, or new types of content, such as equations and charts, to shorthand. Pages are simply AsciiDoc documents that can be edited in any text editor. Creating a page in the documentation is as simple as creating an AsciiDoc document. The document can be opened and previewed in a text editor, or it can be viewed in the context of the site. Antora assigns the page an implicit ID so it can be referenced from other pages, and it can reference other pages using the implicit ID of those pages. Features such as section titles, admonition blocks, and highlighted source listings are styled appropriately. Create references between pages and other resources using a source-to-source xref system that’s concise and easy to construct. Instead of relying on generated filenames or URLs, you create references between pages and other resources using the location of the target in the source system. This makes reasoning about references easy since you only have to think about where the source file is located, not how it gets processed. In other words, you stay in the source coordinate system. And you get the benefit of the context of the current source file, so you only need to specify the traits of the target that differ from the current context. Source-to-source references provide the necessary information to decouple the site from the filesystem and publishing environment. By expressing a reference using a resource ID, Antora can intelligently create a link to the resource in the published output that isn’t coupled with the filesystem or publishing environment. That means the generated site can be viewed anywhere, including offline. Describe the documentation navigation using AsciiDoc lists. Writers using Antora can feel right at home when defining navigation. Why? Because, like pages, the navigation is just another AsciiDoc document. But instead of free-form content, the navigation file contains a list hierarchy that gets translated into the navigation trees you see in the navigation menu sidebar. To add another navigation tree, you simply add an additional list. Create navigation links using the same xref system that’s used in the main content. So how do you create a link to a page from the navigation? Using an xref, of course. Since the navigation file is just content, it can use the same xref system that’s used by the main content to create links between pages. Think of a navigation file as a page that doesn’t get published. And since the file is stored with the content, the xrefs can be contextual, meaning you only have to specify the traits of the target that differ from the current context. The site’s user interface and theme is maintained separately from the content. A key theme in Antora is separation of content and presentation. This is prominently seen in the UI. Antora interfaces with a site UI that is stored and managed as a separate project. It passes a UI model to a Handlebars template that the UI provided. The template then decides what to display from the model, giving the UI full control over the page layout. The template also decides what CSS and JavaScript to include. Iterate on the UI independently from the content. Since the UI and content are maintained separately, they can follow different release cycles. And no toes get stepped on. The work done on the UI does not interfere with the work done on the content. When Antora runs, it fuses the latest content and the latest UI together. This means it’s easy to swap one UI and theme with another, which can be useful for redesigns, A/B testing, or campaigns. You have maximum freedom to tailor the UI and its theme(s) to your needs. Retain URLs of old pages in a transparent way by storing the information in the target document. Change happens. You just need to be ready to deal with it. One of the most frequent changes in a documentation site are the URLs of pages, which change as the pages get renamed or reorganized. Antora provides a way to retain the URLs of old pages by declaring page aliases. Like other features in Antora, this information is stored with the content, in this case in the header of the target AsciiDoc document. Redirects are described using aliases, which are simply inbound xrefs; not coupled to URLs. As you might expect, a page alias is a source reference, which allows Antora to take care of creating the redirect from the correct URL. Since not all hosting environments are the same, the facility for performing a redirect isn’t either. Antora generates the appropriate configuration for the redirect facility that the hosting environment provides, falling back to good old-fashioned static bounce pages if no other mechanism is supported. Publish anywhere, whether local or remote. Sites are meant to be published. Antora helps with that. Whether the destination is local or remote Antora streams the content there using a built-in or custom provider. And yet, no matter where the site is published, the site is not coupled to the host environment. Antora supports as many output streams as you want, which could be a local directory, a local archive, a directory on a remote SSH server, or a web service endpoint like S3, or a combination of destinations. You can be sure Antora gets the files where they need to go for publishing. All in a single build. No need for a separate step, tool or script in the pipeline. Antora’s file publisher saves you a step in the pipeline. Most site generators write the output to a local directory, which you then have to turn around and publish. Antora sends the output directly to the destinations you specify. And since the references in the site are not coupled to the publishing environment, you can even preview the site offline by publishing it to a local directory. Start with the default. Antora offers an opinionated site generator and UI out of the box so you can get up and running quickly. You interface with the site generator using the antora CLI command, which you can install yourself or invoke using the Docker container. Just point the command at your playbook and Antora kicks out a multi-component, multi-version documentation site for you. Once you’ve had a chance to set up or migrate your documentation for use with Antora, you can graduate from the defaults and start tailoring Antora to fit advanced requirements. Tailor Antora just for you. Antora features an open architecture. What does that mean? It means you have the ability to teach Antora new tricks. Perhaps you need to incorporate additional content into Antora’s catalog. Or maybe you want to perform custom processing somewhere along the line. You can even introduce your own behavior to reconfigure Antora to fit your needs. Antora was designed so you can use it as a foundation when the provided site generator doesn’t suit you.","title":"How Antora Can Help You and Your Team","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"features","url":"/antora/3.1/features.html","titles":[{"text":"Agile and secure","hash":"agile-and-secure","id":1},{"text":"Tap into a ready-made collaboration workflow","hash":"tap-into-a-ready-made-collaboration-workflow","id":2},{"text":"Produce a site from a simple playbook","hash":"produce-a-site-from-a-simple-playbook","id":3},{"text":"Bring together content from multiple repositories","hash":"bring-together-content-from-multiple-repositories","id":4},{"text":"Document all the versions","hash":"document-all-the-versions","id":5},{"text":"AsciiDoc: Minimal markup, maximum functionality","hash":"asciidoc-minimal-markup-maximum-functionality","id":6},{"text":"Source-to-source references","hash":"source-to-source-references","id":7},{"text":"Navigation as content","hash":"navigation-as-content","id":8},{"text":"Interchangeable UI","hash":"interchangeable-ui","id":9},{"text":"Built-in support for page redirects","hash":"built-in-support-for-page-redirects","id":10},{"text":"Publish sites to multiple destinations","hash":"publish-sites-to-multiple-destinations","id":11},{"text":"Sensible defaults.

User-defined. Optional. A site URL identifies the location where your site is published. A site URL is defined by assigning an allowable value to the site.url key in the playbook, --url command line option, or URL environment variable. There are two types of allowable site URLs: absolute and root-relative. Antora is designed to generate sites that are viewable offline and from a local filesystem. For this reason, Antora doesn’t require a site URL to build a site. However, when Antora doesn’t detect an allowable site URL value, it automatically deactivates certain publishing features. See Features that depend on the site URL for a complete list of affected features. An absolute site URL begins with https:// and is followed by the site domain or subdomain. Figure 1. Absolute site URL If you’re publishing your site to a subfolder, the site domain is followed by a subpath. Figure 2. Absolute site URL with subpath The subpath, also known as a path segment or pathname, represents the location from the root of the domain where the site managed by Antora is located. That is, if your site is published to a subfolder of your domain, then the absolute site URL should include this path. See Configure an absolute site URL and When should the site URL include a subpath? for more information about using an absolute site URL with a subpath. A root-relative site URL begins with a forward slash (/) and, if more than one character, is the subpath. Figure 3. Root-relative site URL See Configure a root-relative site URL for more information. Computed. The site pathname represents an internal property, site.path, that Antora uses when a publishing feature requires URLs that are relative to the root of your site. Antora computes the site pathname based on the site URL. The site pathname value is typically empty except when an absolute site URL contains a subpath or the site URL is a root-relative site URL. If site.url is an absolute site URL that contains a subpath, Antora extracts the subpath and uses it as the site pathname. For example, using the absolute site URL in Figure 2, Antora extracts the subpath, /docs, and assigns it to site.path. When the value assigned to site.url is a root-relative site URL, Antora extracts the entire value and uses it as the site pathname. Antora appends the resource URLs to the site pathname to create a domain-relative URLs when a feature, such as redirects, requires the computed URLs be relative to the site domain or site root. Antora generates and manages all URLs in your site. Antora builds the resource URLs for publishable resources as absolute paths relative to the site pathname. Then, the resource URLs are converted to URLs relative to the current page, the site URL (site-pathname/resource-URL), or absolute URLs (absolute-site-URL/resource-URL) depending on the context and feature in which the URL is used. Computed. Antora computes a resource URL for each publishable resource in a site. A publishable resource is a source file that belongs to the pages, images, and attachments families. Resource URLs are computed as absolute paths relative to the site pathname so they are normalized across the application. A resource URL begins with a forward slash (/) and contains segments that Antora derives from the ID of a resource and the URL settings in the playbook. These segments often represent the component name, version, module, and resource file name. Figure 4. Resource URL computed by Antora Certain playbook keys can modify, add, or remove portions of a resource URL. Some resource URL segments are added or absent if a resource isn’t a page or it belongs to a ROOT component, an unversioned component version, or a ROOT module. See Resource URL segments for information about each segment and from where Antora extracts their values. Antora assigns the computed resource URL of a resource to the internal property, pub.url, where pub is the property group for properties that pertain to publishing. Computed. Antora converts the references to resources into relative URLs. Antora refers to this translation as relativize. Where the relativize translation occurs depends on the resource, which can be a page, image, attachment, or UI resource. For xrefs and images in AsciiDoc, Antora calls relativize internally in the extended HTML converter for Asciidoctor. For navigation entries, breadcrumbs, pagination links, and the page version selector, the UI uses the relativize helper to convert a resource URL into a relative URL from the current page. For UI resources, the UI uses the uiRootPath variable to create a relative URL to the resource. There are two reasons Antora creates relative URLs to link to resources. First, it keeps the length of the URL as short as possible to curb the size of the generated HTML. More importantly, it ensures that the URL is portable between environments. It’s a key reason why an Antora site works when viewed directly from the filesystem. The relative references don’t rely on a web server to resolve the URL. Instead, they start from the current page and walk up and down the filesystem to the target resource, which works everywhere. For the same reason, it simplifies publishing because the site is not bound to a given domain or site root. Computed. Antora computes domain-relative URLs when creating rewrite rules for page aliases, component version start pages, and the latest version segment redirect:to and replace strategies. If a non-empty value is assigned to the site pathname, Antora prepends the site pathname to the resource URL. When the site pathname is empty, a resource URL is already equivalent to the domain-relative URL. For example, using the resource URL in Figure 4, and the site pathname /docs, Antora computes the domain-relative URL shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Domain-relative URL computed by Antora If the site.url key isn’t set, Antora doesn’t compute domain-relative URLs and the publishing features that require them are automatically deactivated at runtime. Computed. An absolute URL is the full URL for a publishable resource. To compute an absolute URL, Antora starts with an absolute site URL and appends a resource URL. For example, using the site URL in Figure 2 and resource URL in Figure 4, Antora computes the absolute URL shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Absolute URL computed by Antora Figure 6 is an example of how a page’s URL is displayed in the browser address bar or in the sitemap. Antora computes absolute URLs when generating sitemaps and computing the canonical URL for the meta tag in the head of each page. If the site.url key isn’t assigned an absolute site URL, the publishing features that require absolute URLs are automatically deactivated at runtime. The following sections describe each segment of a resource URL and from where Antora extracts the value of each segment. The segments of resource URLs for published pages are typically organized into the sequence shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Resource URL segments for a published page The resource URLs for images and attachments contain an additional family segment, _images or _attachments, respectively. The family segment follows the module segment as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Resource URL segments for a published image The component segment of the URL is the name of the component the published resource belongs to. When the resource belongs to the specially named ROOT component, the component segment is dropped from the URL. A component name is specified by the name key in an antora.yml file. The resource URL that Antora computes and assigns to the pub.url property of a resource always starts with this segment. The version segment of a URL is the actual version or symbolic version of the component version the published resource belongs to. The actual version is the value assigned to the version key in a component version’s antora.yml file or to the version key for a content source that’s specified in the playbook. All component versions have an actual version, though that version may be defined as unversioned. When a component version is unversioned, the version segment is dropped from the URLs of its resources. The symbolic version is an optional configuration setting that only applies to the version segment if the resource belongs to the latest version or latest prerelease version of a component. The symbolic version replaces the actual version in the URL. A symbolic version is defined using the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key in the playbook. The symbolic version doesn’t apply to component versions that are unversioned; the version segment is always dropped from their resources’ published URLs. Antora derives the module segment from the module directory name where a resource’s source file is stored. When the resource belongs to the specially named ROOT module, the module segment is dropped from the URL. See Module Segment in Page URLs for examples and more information. The family segment only applies to the resource URLs of images and attachments. Image and attachment URLs include a family segment that’s prepended with an underscore (_). For images, this segment is _images. For attachments, this segment is _attachments. The URLs for pages do not contain a family segment. The relative path segment is derived from the family-relative path of the resource’s source file. For pages, the .adoc extension is dropped and replaced with .html or the specified HTML extension style. The URLs for other resources maintain the original file extension, such as .svg or .pdf. The .html extension and html_extension_style key only applies to the URLs of pages. By default, Antora appends the .html extension to page URLs. The html_extension_style playbook key or --html-url-extension-style option modifies this behavior. The extension can be dropped (drop) or dropped and replaced with a forward slash (indexify). The URLs of non-page resources use the file extension of their source files, regardless of the value assigned to html_extension_style.","title":"How Antora Builds URLs","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"how-antora-builds-urls","url":"/antora/3.1/how-antora-builds-urls.html","titles":[{"text":"The site URL","hash":"site","id":1},{"text":"Absolute site URL","hash":"absolute-site","id":2},{"text":"Root-relative site URL","hash":"root-relative","id":3},{"text":"Site pathname","hash":"pathname","id":4},{"text":"Right URL, right place","hash":"right-url-right-place","id":5},{"text":"Resource URL","hash":"resource","id":6},{"text":"Relativized URL","hash":"relativized-url","id":7},{"text":"Domain-relative URL","hash":"domain-relative","id":8},{"text":"Absolute URL","hash":"absolute-url","id":9},{"text":"Resource URL segments","hash":"segments","id":10},{"text":"Component segment","hash":"component","id":11},{"text":"Version segment","hash":"version","id":12},{"text":"Module segment","hash":"module","id":13},{"text":"Family segment","hash":"family","id":14},{"text":"Relative path segment","hash":"relative-path","id":15},{"text":"HTML extension","hash":"html-extension","id":16}]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"Antora’s site generator handles all aspects of creating a documentation site, from fetching and aggregating to converting and arranging the content to publishing the files of the generated site. This page describes that process in detail. The default pipeline is opinionated to get you started as quickly as possible. But understand that Antora features a modular, open architecture. That means this architecture can accommodate specialized use cases by allowing custom Antora components, such as a validators, to be inserted into the pipeline at strategic points as needed. This page focuses on the core, built-in Antora components and capabilities in Antora. The steps listed in this section describe the operations the site generator performs. Certain operations are executed asynchronously, so some of the steps below may occur in a different order or happen simultaneously. For example, the UI is fetched and loaded while the content is being aggregated to optimize use of the network. Build playbook When you’re ready to generate a site, you pass Antora a playbook file and tell it to run. A playbook file is a simple configuration file that can be written in YAML, JSON, or TOML. It contains information and settings such as what content to use, how the content should be processed, how the site should be generated, and where to publish the output. Antora reads the playbook file and builds a playbook from it, which it then uses to drive the pipeline. Load content repositories Using the content sources listed in the playbook, Antora loads the specified git repositories or local content folders in preparation to scan them for content files. For each remote URL, Antora clones the remote git repository into a local cache using the built-in git client. If the repository has already been cloned, Antora fetches updates if configured to do so. Finally, Antora determines which references (branches, tags, and start paths) to use from the specified repositories. Find the content source roots Starting at a content source root, Antora identifies a group of files as being part of a component version when it finds a component version descriptor file named antora.yml. These source files can be stored in a single repository, at the root of a repository or in a subpath, or distributed across multiple repositories. Transform input files into virtual file objects Antora collects all of the files—​text, images, samples, and other supporting materials—​from each content source root subtree. Then it creates a virtual file of each input file. Assign files to component version buckets Antora reads the component version descriptor ( antora.yml) files. A component version descriptor associates the files under it with a specified component name and version, that is, a component version. This allows the files to be decoupled from the repository in which they live and makes Antora’s URL agnostic cross references possible. Antora assigns the descriptor information and other source metadata to the virtual files. Then it sorts each file into a virtual collection based on the assigned component version data. A component version typically represents a discrete and unique version of the documentation for a project, library, service, or training course. Compute additional metadata Using site properties from the playbook and information assigned to the files in the previous step, Antora adds module, family, family-relative path, and other metadata values to each file. It also computes the output path (disk) and publish path (URL) information for each publishable file. Organize files into a content catalog Antora further sorts the aggregated files into a content catalog that can be queried and transmitted. Convert AsciiDoc files to embeddable HTML The AsciiDoc files in the page family of the content catalog are converted to embeddable HTML with Asciidoctor.js. Convert navigation files Antora retrieves navigation files from the content catalog, translates their contents into navigation items organized in a specified hierarchy (navigation trees grouped inside a navigation menu), and returns a navigation model. Locate and fetch UI bundle Antora finds the UI bundle using the URL listed in the playbook and fetches it. The UI bundle can be cached locally or remote. Transform UI files into virtual file objects Antora extracts the UI files in the bundle and creates a virtual file object for each file containing the file’s contents and path information. Classify UI files Antora identifies the static UI files using the UI descriptor file (ui.yml) and sets the file type to static. It sets the type for all other files based on their location (asset, layout, helper, partial). Compute UI file output paths For each UI file that is publishable (of type static or asset), Antora computes its output path. Organize UI files into UI catalog The virtual UI files are sorted into a transmittable collection. Wrap converted AsciiDoc content in page templates Antora determines which page template each page requests. It populates the identified UI template with the page’s embeddable HTML, site metadata, context data (component, version) for page, version, and product selectors, and navigation model information for menus and breadcrumbs. Relying on a page template to produce the pages gives the site owner complete control over the construction of the pages, and thus complete control over the UI. Produce sitemap Antora generates a site map that can be used as an internal report or published with the site. This sitemap is partitioned by component name (using a sitemap index). The sitemap index links to the sitemap for each component name, which is where the URLs for the individual pages can be found. Publish site Antora writes the generated pages to a default or user-specified location. The site can be published in multiple formats to multiple locations over multiple protocols using built-in and custom destination providers. It’s possible to substitute the default site generator with a custom one. You first need to create a library or script that exports the function with signature generateSite(args, env). Within that script, you’re free to import core components from Antora to reassemble your own pipeline. You then activate your pipeline by passing the name of the library or script to the --generator option of the Antora CLI.","title":"How Antora Works","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"how-antora-works","url":"/antora/3.1/how-antora-works.html","titles":[{"text":"Steps in the default generator pipeline","hash":"steps-in-the-default-generator-pipeline","id":1}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: How Antora sorts components and component versions. How Antora selects the latest version of a component. Understanding how Antora sorts component versions is important when choosing your versioning scheme and its potential presentation and routing results in your site’s UI. Antora groups component versions into documentation components. The sort order of components in the content catalog is not deterministic. However, when the docs components are accessed through the UI model (site.components), they are sorted in alphabetical order by title. The title of a component is defined by the title key defined in each component version’s antora.yml file. If the title key isn’t set, Antora falls back to the name key when sorting the component. In each component, the versions are sorted according to the component version sorting rules. This sorted list of components is typically used by the UI to present a menu widget that the reader can use to navigate between different components and versions. Antora’s default UI provides such a widget. In the default UI, the list of versions for a given component is shown beneath each component’s title. Antora does not require that components and versions be displayed in this order. If you want them to be shown in a different order, you need to customize the UI template that generates this list. When customizing Antora’s default UI, you would need to edit the partial named nav-explore located at src/partials/nav-explore.hbs in the UI project. The key fragment of that template is the iteration over site.components: {{#each site.components}} ... {{/each}} Antora’s default UI uses the order in which components are stored in the UI model. You can modify this order by passing the list of components to a custom helper function that you must also provide: {{#each (rearrange site.components 'component-b,component-a'}} ... {{/each}} You also have the choice of manually creating a menu entry for each component you want displayed. This strategy would also allow you to exclude certain components. Antora only considers the value of the version key when sorting the component versions of a docs component. The value assigned to the version key determines what versioning scheme, and therefore what order, a component version is placed in under its component title or name in the component version selector menu. The reserved values ~ and null define a component version as unversioned. Scheme Valid Identifiers Example Semantic Integer String that starts with a number and contains at least one dot (.) character String that starts with v, followed by a number, and contains at least one dot (.) character 30 2.4 v90.3 Named All values that don’t match the semantic scheme or the reserved version values (~, null) edge z4 Unversioned ~ null ~ Antora applies the following rules when sorting the component versions of a component: An unversioned component version is displayed in the component version selector menu before named versions if both are present. Named versions of a component are displayed in the component version selector menu before semantic versions if both are present. Named versions of a component are sorted in reverse alphabetical order (e.g., z4, wish, lester). Version identifiers with uppercase letters aren’t recommended in URLs and can prevent portability between web servers. If you use uppercase letters, they come before lowercase letters (e.g., A, a). Semantic versions of a component are displayed in the component version selector menu after named versions if both are present. Semantic versions of a component are sorted in descending order The leading v in a semantic identifier is ignored and versions are sorted according to the first number after the v. The semantic versioning ordering rules are applied. Let’s assume that the component RoseyDB contains several component versions. Some versions use the semantic scheme: v2.5, 4.0, and 3.9. Some are named: utopia and vivid. According to Antora’s sorting rules, the RoseyDB component versions will be displayed in the reference UI in the order listed below. Sorted RoseyDB component versions vivid utopia 4.0 3.9 v2.5 Bear in mind that if the display_version key is defined in a component version’s antora.yml file, the value of display_version is shown instead of the version key’s value. Regardless of whether or not display_version is set, the component version is always sorted according to the value assigned to its version key. Thus, to the reader’s eyes, the versions may not appear to be sorted in the order described. For instance, if the utopia version of RoseyDB is assigned a display_version value of 3.0, the RoseyDB versions will still be sorted in the same order. The utopia version is just labeled as 3.0 in the reference UI. vivid 3.0 4.0 3.9 v2.5 Antora also determines the latest component version of each component. The latest version for RoseyDB would be vivid because it’s the first version in the sorted list and not defined as a prerelease. In addition to sorting the component versions, Antora identifies the most recent, stable component version of each component. The latest component version, also called the latest version, is the first version in the sorted list that’s not a prerelease. If all versions are prereleases, then the first prerelease version in the list is selected. An unversioned component version is always considered the latest version or latest prerelease version (if prerelease is set). Antora uses the latest version of a component when qualifying an incoming resource ID reference from another component if the version coordinate wasn’t specified or can’t otherwise be determined. The latest version is available as the property latest in the UI model.","title":"How Component Versions are Sorted","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"how-component-versions-are-sorted","url":"/antora/3.1/how-component-versions-are-sorted.html","titles":[{"text":"Docs component sort order","hash":"sort-docs-components","id":1},{"text":"Versioning schemes","hash":"version-schemes","id":2},{"text":"Component version sorting rules","hash":"version-sorting-rules","id":3},{"text":"Determine the version order of a component","hash":"determine-version-order","id":4},{"text":"Latest component version","hash":"latest-version","id":5}]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"A module directory can contain an optional family directory named images. 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (1) 📂 images (2) 📄 image-source-file.ext (3) 📁 pages 📄 nav.adoc 📂 named-module (4) 📁 examples 📂 images (5) 📄 image-source-file.ext 📂 subdirectory-of-images (6) 📄 image-source-file.ext 📁 pages 1 A ROOT module directory. 2 An images family directory.

Antora makes it easy for tech writers to create documentation and publish it to the web. As a tech writer, you focus on authoring content in AsciiDoc, Antora’s content markup language. You organize those files into a standard project structure and store them in one or more content (git) repositories. Antora picks up your content from there and transforms it into a website. That’s all there is to it! With Antora, you manage docs as code. That means your documentation process benefits from the same practices used to produce successful software. Some of these practices include: Storing content in a version control system. Separating content, configuration, and presentation. Leveraging automation for compilation, validation, verification, and publishing. Reusing shared materials (DRY). Antora helps you incorporate these practices into your documentation workflow. As a result, your documentation is much easier to manage, maintain, and enhance. If you’re just beginning your journey with Antora, you’ll probably want to know how Antora can help you. When you are familiar with the basic concepts, you can try out Antora using the Antora quickstart guide. If you’re ready to set up a new documentation project, or you want to migrate an existing project to Antora, start by organizing your documentation files into the project structure Antora expects. You’ll then need to create a playbook to tell Antora where to find the documentation and UI to use for your site. If you already have a documentation component set up, and you’re ready to create your first site, check that you’ve met Antora’s system requirements, then install Antora, and finally generate your site using the antora command. If you want to jump into writing, learn how to use the AsciiDoc syntax to create documentation pages. You may find the IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin to be an author’s best friend. Not only does it assist with writing and previewing AsciiDoc content, it also provides state of the art tooling for creating and validating Antora configuration and resource references.

To generate documentation sites with Antora, you need the Antora command line interface (CLI) and the Antora site generator. To install Antora, begin by making a new directory for your site named docs-site and switch to it. $ mkdir docs-site && cd docs-site Next, let’s initialize a package.json file and install the required packages within the playbook project so you can run the antora command using npx. $ node -e \"fs.writeFileSync('package.json', '{}')\" $ npm i -D -E antora Refer to Security Bulletins to remediate any security vulnerabilities that are reported. Verify the antora command is available by running: $ npx antora -v If the installation is successful, the command will report the version of the Antora CLI and site generator packages you specified. $ npx antora -v @antora/cli: 3.1.9 @antora/site-generator: 3.1.9 These versions can also be found in package.json (pulled in transitively by the antora package), which you can use to upgrade Antora. You have the option of installing Antora globally so that the antora command is available on your PATH. To do so, pass the -g option to npm i. $ npm i -g antora You can verify that the antora command is available on your path by running: $ antora -v We strongly recommend that you install Antora within the playbook project. This strategy makes it easier to manage the version of Antora. It also ensures that the version of Antora matches the version for which the playbook was made. Now you’re ready to create your first playbook. See Install Antora for more detailed information and additional installation methods. To produce a documentation site, Antora needs a playbook. Using your preferred text editor or IDE, create a new file and populate it with the configuration information listed below. Save this file as antora-playbook.yml in the docs-site directory you made in the previous step. This playbook file will create a site using the Antora demo repositories. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Antora Docs start_page: component-b::index.adoc (1) content: sources: (2) - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git branches: HEAD - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v2.0, v1.0] start_path: docs ui: (3) bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable snapshot: true 1 A page from a component version to be used as the home page for your site. 2 The sources category contains the list of git repository locations, branch name patterns, and other repository properties that Antora uses when aggregating the site content. 3 The ui category contains keys that specify the location of the UI bundle and how it should be processed. See the Antora playbook for more detailed information about the playbook file. To generate the site, point the antora command at your playbook file. In the terminal, make sure you’re in docs-site directory, then type: $ npx antora --fetch antora-playbook.yml Antora will clone the content and UI repositories and generate your documentation site to the default output directory. By default, Antora does not sync the repository once it clones it. Instead, it tries to work offline by using the repository in the cache it previously cloned. This default can create some confusion when getting started. Therefore, we recommend including the --fetch option in the command until you’re more familiar with Antora. You can also set the fetch key in your playbook to enable this setting permanently. Navigate to the docs-site/build/site directory and open the index.html file in your browser to see the result. Congratulations! You’ve successfully built your first site with Antora. For more detailed information about running Antora and troubleshooting help, see Run Antora to generate your site.

A module directory may also contain zero or more navigation files. There are two types of module directories: named module directories and the ROOT module directory. At runtime, Antora collects the source files stored in the ROOT and named module directories and assigns them to modules. By convention, the module name corresponds to the name of the module folder. A module is a collection of content in a component version that’s related by concept, stage, feature, or other project-specific grouping. While the module does get represented as a URL segment in the published site, it’s primarily an organization tool for the writer. A module cannot be individually configured (meaning it has no metadata of its own). The module name and the name of the module folder are the same.

Antora assigns the name of a module from the name of a module folder. A module name is used as the module coordinate in the resource IDs of pages, images, attachments, examples, and partials. It’s also used in the URLs of the publishable resources assigned to that module (except for the ROOT module). When choosing a module folder name, keep the following requirements and recommendations in mind: Named module directories can’t contain blank spaces or forward slashes (/). These characters aren’t permitted in the targets of AsciiDoc cross references, image macros, or include directives. If possible, don’t use uppercase letters, underscores (_), and other characters that aren’t recommended in URLs. Such characters can limit web server portability, downgrade site search results, and cause visitor accessibility problems. If the module name ends in the name of a built-in macro, such as link, that part of the name may need to be escaped when using in an xref macro. For example, elink will have to be written as e\\link to prevent the AsciiDoc parser from seeing the link macro. If your team often references resources across modules, they’ll have to type a module’s name in the resource IDs, so don’t make the folder name, and hence the module name, too long or hard to remember.

Before setting up or migrating your repositories, let’s review some key concepts that could impact how you organize your documentation projects and content files to work with Antora. Antora can retrieve content source files from numerous git repositories by searching for files or their symlinks under a start path or multiple start paths in branches, tags, or a local worktree. The repositories Antora uses don’t have to be reserved exclusively for storing documentation (hence the start path). Antora can retrieve files from repositories that also host application code, tests, and other materials in sibling hierarchies. Antora relies on both convention and configuration to identify the documentation content. In order to fetch source files from multiple and multi-use repositories, Antora requires that the documentation files be: Located under a content source root Labeled with a file named antora.yml Organized into a standard set of directories Although not required, we strongly recommend that you always use lowercase for filenames. Some filesystems are case sensitive, while others are not. By always using lowercase, you avoid any problems that occur if the filesystem, webserver, or transfer tool does not preserve the casing. Once Antora collects the source files from all content source roots, it classifies each file by assigning metadata to it, which is used to uniquely identify the file within the site. The file’s identifier, called a resource ID, is used for creating references from pages, other resources, and the configuration. This step also implicitly partitions the source files into component versions. Antora decouples source files from their storage locations after it collects them. For all intents and purposes, the origin of each file is irrelevant. In other words, Antora never goes back to the filesystem or git repository to read the file once it’s discovered and loaded. Antora bases all of its file operations on the virtual filesystem (VFS) it creates after it collects the files. The only aspect of a file that maps back to the location on the filesystem is the family-relative path. And even this association is maintained merely as a convenience for the author. Aside from the family-relative path, all other parts of the file’s identity are based on associative metadata, such as the component name, version, module name, and family. So how does a file get this metadata? All files in the same content source root inherit the component name and version from the component version descriptor file, named antora.yml. These descriptor files help Antora sort and organize all of the collected source files into component versions. You can think of a component version as all of the documentation for a version of a project. For example, you’re reading a page in the Antora 3.1 component version right now. These antora.yml files are how content that belongs to the same version of a project can be identified by Antora. It’s also how component versions are defined and populated implicitly. Inside a content source root, files are further grouped into module and family folders, which provide two more facets of a source file’s identity. Finally, the family-relative path is captured to uniquely identify a source file within a family, even across multiple repositories or git references. The location of a source file doesn’t dictate the location of the published file. Once a source file is loaded into Antora’s VFS, the file’s metadata is manipulated, which includes computing the file’s output location and URL. Each family of files has different rules for how these values are computed. The association between where the source file is found, where the published file is placed in the site, or how that file is accessed isn’t hardwired. See What’s a component version? and What’s antora.yml? to learn how to assign a component name, version and other optional information to groups of content source files. git refnames, which includes the names of branches and tags, should only contain characters that do not need to be URL encoded. This rule is not enforced by git, but violating it can cause subtle problems in Antora. While the refname does not appear in the URL of published resources, it is used in references back to the file’s origin. Specifically, using characters in the refname which have to be URL encoded complicates the assembly of the edit URL for pages. As an example, the character # violates this rule, which would have to be encoded as %23. Although Antora will happily build the edit URL to include this character, the URL will not be interpreted as expected by the browser. That’s because # marks the boundary between the URL that’s sent to the server and the fragment that’s only seen by the browser. The result will be an incomplete URL and thus a 404 page. It’s acceptable to use the universal directory separator, /, in refnames. By doing so, it effectively organizes the refs into a folder structure (e.g., r/3.0.x). However, this strategy can impact refname matching. The * character in a refname pattern does not match / (it does not cross the boundary of a folder). Therefore, to match a refname such as r/3.0.x, you must use the pattern r/* instead of r*.","title":"How to Organize Your Content Files","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"organize-content-files","url":"/antora/3.1/organize-content-files.html","titles":[{"text":"Storing your content source files","hash":"storing-your-content-source-files","id":1},{"text":"Classifying your content source files","hash":"classifying-your-content-source-files","id":2},{"text":"Antora’s virtual filesystem","hash":"antoras-virtual-filesystem","id":3},{"text":"File metadata","hash":"file-metadata","id":4},{"text":"File locations and URLs","hash":"file-locations-and-urls","id":5},{"text":"git refnames","hash":"git-refnames","id":6}]},"63":{"id":63,"text":"A module directory can contain a family directory named pages.

That means Antora automatically converts each page to HTML and publishes it as an individual page in a site, even if the page isn’t referenced by another resource or navigation file.

Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in the partials directory when it generates a site. Antora classifies the source files stored in a partials directory as partial files, or partials for short. Partials are usually AsciiDoc files that contain content snippets, such as common descriptions or terminology, that are inserted into one or more pages or partials. However, Antora doesn’t require partials to be AsciiDoc files. When saving a new partial file, keep the following filename requirements and recommendations in mind: A partial’s filename can’t contain spaces because the AsciiDoc include directive doesn’t accept values with spaces. Uppercase letters aren’t recommended in filenames. Some file systems aren’t case sensitive. Therefore, file conflicts could occur depending on the file system a writer is using. Save a partial file with the .adoc extension when it’s an AsciiDoc file, otherwise use the valid file extension for the file type. You should only save a partial without a file extension when it’s common industry practice for that specific file type to not have an extension. Not using the correct file extension when saving a partial file may limit your ability to apply some Antora extensions or upgrade to future capabilities. A partial isn’t required to have a file extension. Unlike a publishable resource that’s treated as a hidden file if it’s missing a file extension, Antora will load a partial that doesn’t have a file extension into its content catalog and assign the partial a resource ID for referencing. Antora doesn’t publish partial files as individual site pages. A partial must be referenced by an include directive from a page, or resource that’s eventually included in a page, for the partial’s content to be published.

How to run an optional local server to preview a site locally. Since Antora generates static sites, you do not have to publish the site to a web server to view it. A site generated by Antora works just as well using the browser’s local file: protocol. This characteristic of an Antora site is an essential tool for previewing your work. To view the site locally, navigate to any HTML page inside the destination folder in your browser. If you’re following along with the Demo, look for the file build/site/index.html in your project. You will be viewing the HTML pages through the file: protocol of the browser, which you can see in the location bar. Although the site is viewable without a web server, you may still need to view your site through a web server to test certain features, such as indexified URLs, caching, or scripts that don’t work over the file: protocol. You can use the http-server package for this purpose. http-server is a simple, static web server for Node.js. The most straightforward way to use http-server is to invoke it using npx: demo-site $ npx http-server -v If you prefer, you can install the package globally using npm instead. demo-site $ npm i -g http-server That puts a command by the same name on your PATH so you don’t need to prefix it with npx. We’ll assume for the purpose of this tutorial that you are calling http-server using npx. Now launch the web server by pointing it at the location of the generated site. In the terminal, type the command name, npx http-server, followed by the location of the generated site (i.e., the output dir). We also recommend adding the -c-1 flag to disable caching. demo-site $ npx http-server build/site -c-1 Upon launching the command, the local address of the web server will be displayed in your terminal. You should see the following output in your terminal: Starting up http-server, serving build/site Available on: http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://192.168.1.8:8080 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server Paste the first provided URL into the location bar of your browser to view your site through a local web server. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server. If you get a port conflict when starting the server (i.e., listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use), you can use the -p option to change to another port. For example, append -p 5000 to the command to switch to port 5000. demo-site $ npx http-server build/site -c-1 -p 5000","title":"Preview Your Site","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"preview-site","url":"/antora/3.1/preview-site.html","titles":[{"text":"Local site preview","hash":"local-site-preview","id":1},{"text":"Run a local server (optional)","hash":"run-a-local-server-optional","id":2}]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"Antora is designed to create sites that run anywhere, whether it be on a static web host or the local filesystem. However, some hosts offer “features” that mess with Antora’s output. GitHub Pages is one of those hosts. By default, GitHub Pages runs all files through another static site generator named Jekyll (even if your repository is not set up to use Jekyll). Since Antora already produces a ready-made site, there’s absolutely no need for this step. But it’s more than just the wasted effort. Jekyll has the nasty side effect of removing all files that begin with an underscore (_). Why is this a problem? By default, Antora puts UI files in a folder named _. It also places images inside the folder named _images. When Jekyll comes through, it wipes out these folders. As a result, you get no UI and no images. Fortunately, there’s a way to disable this “feature” of GitHub Pages. The solution is to add a .nojekyll file to the root of the published site (i.e., the output directory configured in your playbook). The presence of the .nojekyll file at the root of the gh-pages branch tells GitHub Pages not to run the published files through Jekyll. The result is that your Antora-made site will work as expected. Let’s look at two ways to create the .nojekyll file when you run Antora. One way to add this file is to touch the .nojekyll file in the output directory after Antora runs, but before committing the files to GitHub Pages. For example: $ touch build/site/.nojekyll Fortunately, there’s way to do this without having to run a separate command. To avoid the need for the extra command, the other way to do it is to inject the file using Antora’s supplemental UI feature. To do so, add the following supplemental_files block under the ui category in your playbook file: Example 1. antora-playbook.yml that adds .nojekyll file using supplemental UI ui: bundle: url: supplemental_files: - path: ui.yml contents: | static_files: - .nojekyll - path: .nojekyll This configuration defines files from memory. The first file, ui.yml, tells Antora which files to promote to the root of the site (outside the UI folder) using the static_files key. The second file, .nojekyll, gets written to the root of the published site. Since the contents key is absent, Antora will create an empty file (the equivalent of the touch command from above). If your playbook repository is hosted on GitHub, you can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish your site to GitHub Pages. The benefit of using GitHub Actions is two-fold. First, you don’t have to worry about copying the published files to the gh-pages branch for publishing. Second, you don’t have to worry about the .nojekyll file since the action handles it for you. Let’s get started! Example 2 shows an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the latest stable release of Antora to build and publish your site to GitHub Pages. This workflow assumes that the name of the default branch of your playbook repository is main, that the name of your playbook file is antora-playbook.yml, and that Antora is configured to publish the files to the build/site directory. If your site uses different settings, you’ll need to update the values in the workflow file accordingly. Example 2. .github/workflows/publish.yml builds the Antora site and deploys it to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions name: Publish to GitHub Pages on: push: branches: [main] # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab workflow_dispatch: concurrency: group: github-pages cancel-in-progress: false # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: github-pages url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Configure Pages uses: actions/configure-pages@v3 - name: Install Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v4 with: node-version: '18' - name: Install Antora run: npm i antora - name: Generate Site run: npx antora antora-playbook.yml - name: Upload Artifacts uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2 with: path: build/site - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2 As Example 2 shows, you can install and invoke Antora directly from the workflow. This workflow installs a specific release of Antora (both the CLI and site generator packages) and then uses the Antora CLI in the workflow. The workflow then uses the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action to publish the site, along with the required .nojekyll file, to GitHub Pages. To install and use a different version of Antora, append a version to the package name, such as antora@3.0.3. Let’s now take this a step further by adding the Antora Lunr Extension to incorporate a search widget in the built site. First, you need to update your playbook repository and UI to meet the minimum requirements of the Antora Lunr Extension as described in the README for that project. Once that’s done, return to the GitHub Actions workflow and configure it to install the extension at the same time it installs Antora. The result is shown in Example 3. Example 3. .github/workflows/publish.yml includes the Antora Lunr Extension name: Publish to GitHub Pages with Lunr Search Extension on: push: branches: [main] # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab workflow_dispatch: concurrency: group: github-pages cancel-in-progress: false # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: github-pages url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Configure Pages uses: actions/configure-pages@v3 - name: Install Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v4 with: node-version: '18' - name: Install Antora with the Antora Lunr Extension run: npm i antora @antora/lunr-extension - name: Generate Site run: npx antora antora-playbook.yml - name: Upload Artifacts uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2 with: path: build/site - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2 To install and use a different version of the Antora Lunr Extension, append a version to the package name, such as @antora/lunr-extension@1.0.0-alpha.5. You can serve your site from a different URL than the default .github.io using a Github Pages custom domain. If you’re publishing your site Using GitHub Actions as the source, then you can configure your custom domain from the Settings Pages configuration screen in the GitHub web interface. No other action is required in the CI workflow. On the other hand, if you’re publishing your site from a branch (e.g., gh-pages), then you need to write the custom domain to a CNAME file at the root of the site. In order to do so, add the following step to your GitHub Actions workflow file (or the equivalent for whatever CI pipeline you’re using) after running Antora. - name: Create CNAME file run: echo my-domain-name.com > build/site/CNAME Alternately, you can use a supplemental UI to add the CNAME file, similar to how the .nojekyll file was added earlier. Example 4. antora-playbook.yml that adds CNAME file using supplemental UI ui: bundle: url: supplemental_files: - path: ui.yml contents: | static_files: - CNAME - path: CNAME contents: | my-domain-name.com This configuration defines files from memory. The first file, ui.yml, tells Antora which files to promote to the root of the site (outside the UI folder) using the static_files key. The second file, CNAME, gets written to the root of the published site and contains the custom domain name, as required by GitHub Pages when publishing from a branch. The benefit of this approach is that it does not require an extra step in the CI workflow. Refer to Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site in the GitHub documentation for more information about using a custom domain and how to activate it.","title":"Publish to GitHub Pages","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"publish-to-github-pages","url":"/antora/3.1/publish-to-github-pages.html","titles":[{"text":"Jekyll and underscore files","hash":"jekyll-and-underscore-files","id":1},{"text":".nojekyll","hash":"nojekyll","id":2},{"text":"Touch the file manually","hash":"touch-the-file-manually","id":3},{"text":"Use the supplemental UI","hash":"use-the-supplemental-ui","id":4},{"text":"Using GitHub Actions","hash":"using-github-actions","id":5},{"text":"Using a custom domain","hash":"using-a-custom-domain","id":6}]},"67":{"id":67,"text":"GitLab is a DevOps platform that provides everything you need to publish your Antora-based documentation to the web. On this page, we’ll explore how to use GitLab to publish your first documentation site using Antora. Each GitLab project provides code hosting (a git repository), continuous integration (GitLab CI), and static web hosting with redirect support (GitLab Pages). GitLab is thus suitable to manage your entire Antora-based documentation site end-to-end, from source to published site. To use GitLab CI/CD for publishing an Antora site, you need: A playbook project, which starts as a local git repository that stores the Antora playbook file. Zero or more content projects, each with a git repository that hosts the content files. A file named .gitlab-ci.yml in the root of the git repository in your playbook project, which provides the CI/CD configuration. Before proceeding, we recommend studying core CI/CD concepts and the overview of the .gitlab-ci.yml file in the GitLab documentation. Begin by creating a new project on GitLab to host your playbook project. Follow the instructions on that page to push your local git repository to GitLab. If your playbook refers to other content source repositories, make sure to push those to GitLab as well. Next, you’ll need to configure CI/CD. You only need to set up GitLab CI/CD in the default branch of your playbook repository. Antora will fetch content from other repositories that are declared in your playbook automatically. We’ll start with a basic GitLab CI/CD configuration file that uses the Antora Docker image to build a site with Antora and publish it to GitLab Pages. Example 1. .gitlab-ci.yml to build and deploy an Antora site image: name: antora/antora pages: stage: deploy interruptible: true script: - antora --fetch --redirect-facility=gitlab --to-dir=public antora-playbook.yml artifacts: paths: - public Commit the .gitlab-ci.yml file to git and push it to the remote repository. That will trigger the first CI/CD pipeline. If the pipeline succeeds, your site will be accessible at the URL listed on the Pages settings page. By default, GitLab Pages automatically enables the Use unique domain option, which adds a unique number to the URL where the site is hosted. Chances are, this is not what you want. It’s not only an obscure URL, it can disrupt the use of a custom domain. Follow these steps to correct it: Navigate to the Deploy Pages menu option from the project repository. De-select the Use unique domain option. Click Save changes. The URL for the GitLab Pages site will now follow this pattern: https://.gitlab.io/ The site will be public even if the project is private. You can refer to the playbook project for the Antora demo to see another example of building and publishing an Antora site using GitLab Pages that taps into a few additional capabilities of GitLab CI/CD. So far, we’ve relied on the Antora Docker image to run Antora in CI/CD. The Antora Docker image only provides the Antora core components. It does not include any extensions. While using the Antora Docker image is a convenient way to get up and running quickly, we strongly recommend declaring the dependencies of your site within your playbook project (or extending the Docker image). By doing so, you keep your build self-contained and portable. This is especially important if you rely on additional packages such as the @antora/lunr-extension and asciidoctor-kroki. Let’s assume you have the following package.json file in your playbook project that declares a dependency on Antora, the Antora Lunr Extension, and Asciidoctor Kroki. Example 2. package.json { \"name\": \"my-docs-site\", \"description\": \"My Docs Site\", \"private\": true, \"devDependencies\": { \"antora\": \"~3.0\", \"@antora/lunr-extension\": \"1.0.0-alpha.8\", \"asciidoctor-kroki\": \"0.15.4\" } } You’ll first want to run npm i to generate the package-lock.json file and commit both files. With that configuration in place, you can modify your GitLab CI/CD configuration to be based on node:16-alpine, the base image used by Antora Docker. You’ll then need to fetch the dependencies on each build since the base image does not provide Antora. Example 3. .gitlab-ci.yml image: name: node:16-alpine (1) variables: ANTORA_CACHE_DIR: .cache/antora (2) NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=4096 (3) before_script: - npm ci (4) pages: stage: deploy interruptible: true rules: - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH (5) cache: paths: - .cache (2) script: - npx antora --fetch --redirect-facility=gitlab antora-playbook.yml (6) artifacts: paths: - public (7) 1 The base image used by Antora Docker, which you can use if you’re installing packages locally to the playbook project. 2 Stores the repository and UI bundle cache between runs. 3 (optional) Increases the memory reserved for the Node.js to allow Antora to process heavier builds. 4 Installs dependencies defined in the package-lock.js file. Using npm ci instead of npm i ensures that the versions of your dependencies remain stable between runs. 5 Only run on the default branch for this repository. 6 Call Antora using npx, which will locate and run the antora command installed within the project. The --fetch flag ensure Antora fetches updates into the cache saved from a previous run. 7 The public directory is the predefined folder for publishing as site to GitLab Pages. If any of your content repositories are private, you can define a GIT_CREDENTIALS CI/CD variable that holds the credentials to give Antora access to those repositories in this environment. You can set up deploy tokens in your content repository to give the CI/CD pipeline in your playbook project (and thus Antora) read-only access to those repositories. If you want Antora to fail the CI/CD pipeline if there are any warnings or non-fatal errors, add --log-failure-level=warn to the antora command. Alternately, you can set the runtime.log.failure_level key in the playbook to make it a permanent setting.","title":"Publish to GitLab Pages","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"publish-to-gitlab-pages","url":"/antora/3.1/publish-to-gitlab-pages.html","titles":[{"text":"GitLab overview","hash":"gitlab-overview","id":1},{"text":"Get started","hash":"get-started","id":2},{"text":"Customize the build","hash":"customize-the-build","id":3}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"Assumptions: You’ve installed the Antora CLI and a site generator pipeline. You have your own playbook, or you’re using the Demo playbook. Your playbook is configured to access at least one of your own repositories containing content source files or Antora’s Demo content repositories. Your playbook is configured to use a custom UI bundle or Antora’s default UI bundle. On this page, you’ll learn: How to run Antora and generate a site. You don’t need to set up a playbook file, component version, or UI to evaluate Antora. Instead, you can use the Antora demo playbook and content repositories. The demo consists of a playbook repository containing a playbook file and content repositories (component-a and component-b) to which that playbook refers. It also uses the UI bundle produced by the default UI project. Once you’ve installed Antora, you can run Antora using the demo materials to explore its capabilities. The instructions and examples on this page will guide you through the process. To produce a documentation site, Antora needs a playbook. But first, you’ll need to create or choose a directory where you’ll store the playbook and where the generated site files will be saved (assuming you use the default output configuration). For the examples on this page, we’ll use the demo playbook and content repositories. Open a terminal and make a new directory named demo-site. ~ $ mkdir demo-site Switch (cd) into the directory you just made. ~ $ cd demo-site Using your preferred text editor or IDE, create a new playbook file named antora-playbook.yml and populate it with the contents of the following example. Or, you can download the playbook file from the demo project repository. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Antora Demo Site url: https://my-antora-demo-site.org (1) start_page: component-b::index.adoc (2) content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git branches: HEAD - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v2.0, v1.0] start_path: docs ui: bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable snapshot: true 1 The 404 page and sitemap files are only generated if the site url key is set. The sitemap files are only generated if the value of the site url key is an absolute URL. 2 The site start_page key accepts the same resource ID syntax that’s used in xrefs. Save the playbook as antora-playbook.yml in the demo-site directory you made in Step 1. To generate the site with the default Antora site generator, point the antora command at your playbook file. In the terminal, type: demo-site $ antora antora-playbook.yml If Antora is installed locally, you’ll need to prefix the Antora command with npx: demo-site $ npx antora antora-playbook.yml Antora will clone the content repositories. The cloning progress of each repository is displayed in the terminal. Repository cloning progress [clone] https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git [################] [clone] https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git [################] Once cloning is complete, Antora converts the AsciiDoc pages to embeddable HTML, wraps the HTML in the UI page templates, then assembles the pages into a site under the destination folder, which defaults to build/site. Antora has completed generation when the command prompt ($) reappears in the terminal. If the terminal is interactive (TTY), Antora will also print a message that the site generation is complete. The message will include the URL where you can view the site locally. (You can override Antora’s TTY detection by setting the IS_TTY environment variable to true or false). If something goes wrong during generation, you’ll see an error message in the terminal. error: a message that summarizes what went wrong If this message does not provide enough information to fix the problem, you can ask Antora for more context. To tell Antora to reveal the calls leading up to the error (i.e., the stacktrace), run the antora command again, this time with the --stacktrace option: demo-site $ antora --stacktrace antora-playbook.yml Share this stacktrace when asking for help. Switch into the site folder (cd) and list (ls) its contents. demo-site $ cd build/site/ Inside the build/site folder, run: site $ ls -1 You should see the following list of files and directories: _ 404.html component-a component-b index.html sitemap-component-a.xml sitemap-component-b.xml sitemap.xml The 404 page and sitemap files will be missing if the site.url property is not defined in your playbook. The main sitemap file is actually a sitemap index. That file links to the sitemap for each component, which is where the URL for the individual pages can be found. This list includes the entry point of your documentation site, index.html. On some operating systems, you can open the site directly from the command line by typing open, followed by the name of the HTML file. site $ open index.html Or, you can navigate to an HTML page inside the destination folder in your browser. If you’ve been following along with the Demo materials, once you find the demo-site directory, navigate to the file build/site/index.html. Antora can authenticate with private repositories using HTTP Basic authentication over HTTPS. See Private repository authentication to learn more. Antora may fail to read a git repository if it contains very large pack files (those > 2g). If this situation occurs, you will get the following error: FATAL (antora) : Cannot read properties of null (reading 'slice') This failure is caused by a known limitation of the git client Antora uses (isomorphic-git). The limitation is due to a hard limit in the memory settings of the Node.js runtime. Here’s the underlying error message: RangeError [ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE]: File size is greater than 2 GiB 2g is the max buffer size in Node.js. In other words, Node.js has an upper limit to the size of a file it’s able to read into memory. If the pack file exceeds this size, Node.js and, in turn, isomoprhic-git, will fail. In order to read larger files, isomorphic-git would have to switch to streams instead of putting the whole file in a buffer, if that’s even feasible. For a local git repository, the workaround is to configure git so it caps the size of any pack files it creates locally. This is done using the pack.packSizeLimit config setting. $ git config pack.packSizeLimit 1g && git gc You can find information about this setting on the git-pack-objects help page in the git documentation. Keep in mind that this workaround will only help with a local repository (a repository that is already cloned and configured). Changing the pack size of the local repository isn’t going to change the storage settings of the remote repository. The pack.packSizeLimit needs to be adjusted on the git server as well so git doesn’t attempt to send pack files that are too large over the wire.","title":"Run Antora to Generate Your Site","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"run-antora","url":"/antora/3.1/run-antora.html","titles":[{"text":"Antora demo playbook and content repositories","hash":"antora-demo-playbook-and-content-repositories","id":1},{"text":"Choose a playbook","hash":"choose-a-playbook","id":2},{"text":"Run Antora","hash":"run-antora","id":3},{"text":"Private git repositories","hash":"using-private-repositories","id":4},{"text":"Repositories with large pack files","hash":"repositories-with-large-pack-files","id":5}]},"69":{"id":69,"text":"The ROOT directory is an optional module directory.

It can also contain an optional navigation file. The source files stored in a ROOT directory become part of a ROOT module in a component version. We recommended that you create a ROOT module directory because Antora applies special preset behavior to the publishable resources in a ROOT module. For example, the source file index.adoc in the pages directory becomes the default start page for a component version. Those familiar with the terminology of HTML web hosting will recognize this as the index page for a component version. Small documentation projects may never need more than a ROOT module directory. However, as your project grows, you can easily add more module directories and gradually reorganize your source files. While the extra structure seems like overkill now, in the long run, you’ll be glad you gave your content the space to grow. Source files that are stored in a ROOT directory become part of a module named ROOT in a component version. A ROOT module’s pages become the top-level pages of a component version. In other words, unlike other modules, the name of the ROOT module does not get used in the generated site. You can think of the name “ROOT” as an alias for a blank module name (i.e., no module segment). Using this special value allows all modules to be siblings. It’s important to carefully consider what files you store in a ROOT module directory since there is a potential for them to conflict with files in the named module directories. Generally, the ROOT module doesn’t use topic folders for this reason. When you reference content that belongs to a ROOT module from another module or component version, you’ll specify the module name ROOT in the resource IDs for pages, attachments, images, examples, and partials. ROOT is always written in uppercase letters when it’s specified. Since Antora considers the pages in a ROOT module to be top-level component version pages, the module name ROOT isn’t displayed in the module segment of its page URLs.","title":"ROOT Module Directory","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"root-module-directory","url":"/antora/3.1/root-module-directory.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s a ROOT module directory?","hash":"root-dir","id":1},{"text":"What’s a ROOT module?","hash":"root-module","id":2},{"text":"Where’s the ROOT module name used?","hash":"where-root-name-is-used","id":3}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"A prompt response to software defects and security vulnerabilities is a top priority for Antora.

This page introduces this hierarchy, the reserved directory and file names it employs, and the rules about which files get collected or ignored. The set of files and directories, the reserved file and directory names, and their hierarchy that starts at a content source root—​collectively referred to as Antora’s standard file and directory set — helps Antora determine which files to collect, the role of each file, how to classify each file, and which files to ignore. Example 1 shows the hierarchy Antora expects if all of the required and optional files and directories that make up the standard file and directory set are used. In the following examples, 📒 repository represents the root of the file tree of a single reference, such as a branch, in a git repository. Example 1.

By default, Antora assumes the content source root is at the root of a repository unless the start_path or start_paths key is assigned a value on a content source in your site’s playbook. 2 A component version descriptor file, named antora.yml (reserved file name), is required at each content source root. An antora.yml file indicates to Antora that the contents of a directory named modules should be collected and processed. 3 Required directory named modules (reserved directory name). A modules directory must be located at the same hierarchical level as an antora.yml file in a content source root. That is, the antora.yml file and modules directory are siblings. A modules directory must contain, at a minimum, either a ROOT module directory or a named module directory. 4 Optional ROOT module directory. Antora applies special behavior to the publishable resources in a ROOT module directory. ROOT is a reserved directory name and must be in all uppercase letters. A module directory must contain at least one family directory. 5 Optional attachments family directory (reserved directory name). 6 Optional examples family directory (reserved directory name). 7 Optional images family directory (reserved directory name). 8 Optional pages family directory (reserved directory name). 9 Optional partials family directory (reserved directory name). 10 Optional navigation file named nav.adoc. 11 Optional named module directory. You can create as many named module directories as you require. A module directory must contain at least one family directory. 12 Optional navigation file named nav.adoc. 13 Antora won’t process the files in this directory because it’s located outside the modules directory. In Example 1, the content source root is located at the root of the repository. However, a content source root doesn’t have to be at the root of a repository. In Example 2, the content source root is located in a directory of the repository. Example 2.

By default, Antora assumes the repository root and content source root are the same. If you’ve structured a repository where a content source root is located within a directory of the repository, you must specify the path to the directory using the start_path or start_paths key in your site’s playbook. Many of the directories shown in Example 1 and Example 2 are optional. You only have to set up one module directory—​and it can be a ROOT or named module directory—​if that’s all you need. Also, you only need to set up the family directories in a module directory that best apply to the type and purpose of your source files. For example, if you aren’t inserting any images into the pages stored in a module directory, then you don’t need to create an images directory. In the next section, you can see two content source examples that meet Antora’s minimum requirements of a valid standard file and directory set. From a content source root, Antora must find: An antora.yml file located at the content source root A modules directory located at the same hierarchical level as an antora.yml file At least one module directory in the modules directory At least one family directory containing at least one source file in the module directory Let’s look at two examples showing standard file and directory sets that meet the minimum requirements. The directory and file set in Example 3 is valid because it contains the required antora.yml and modules directory at the content source root. The modules directory contains one module directory, in this case the special ROOT module directory. In turn, the ROOT module directory contains a family directory that contains one source file. Example 3. Valid standard file and directory set containing a ROOT module directory 📒 repository (1) 📄 antora.yml (2) 📂 modules (3) 📂 ROOT (4) 📂 pages (5) 📄 page-source-file.adoc (6) 1 In this example, the content source root is at the root of the repository. 2 Component version descriptor file, with the valid filename antora.yml. 3 modules directory. 4 ROOT module directory. 5 pages family directory. 6 Source file of a page. In Example 4, the content source root is located at the directory ops-training. Example 4. Valid standard file and directory set containing a named module directory 📒 repository 📂 courses 📂 ops-training (1) 📄 antora.yml (2) 📂 modules (3) 📂 rz-interface (4) 📂 images (5) 📄 image-source-file.ext (6) 1 Content source root. 2 Component version descriptor file, with the valid filename antora.yml. 3 modules directory. 4 A module directory named rz-interface. 5 images family directory. 6 Source file of an image. The standard directory and file set in Example 4 is also valid. A hidden file is any file stored in Antora’s standard directory hierarchy that begins with a dot (.). Files that don’t have file extensions are also hidden, unless they’re stored in an examples directory or partials directory. Hidden files do not get added to Antora’s content catalog, and therefore aren’t assigned a resource ID, can’t be referenced, and aren’t published. Example 5. Standard directory set containing hidden files 📒 repository 📄 antora.yml 📂 modules 📂 ROOT 📂 examples 📄 .hidden-example-file.ext (1) 📄 example-file (2) 📂 pages 📄 .hidden-page-file.adoc (3) 📄 hidden-page-file (4) 1 Antora won’t load this example file into the content catalog because its filename begins with a dot (.). 2 Files stored in the examples directory aren’t required to have a file extension, therefore Antora will load this example file into the content catalog. 3 Antora won’t load this page file into the content catalog or publish it because its filename begins with a dot (.). 4 Antora won’t load this page file into the content catalog or publish it because it’s missing a file extension and page files must have a file extension. Except when it’s typical for a file type to not have a file extension, such as Dockerfile, it’s a good practice to save example and partial source files with their valid file extensions. If you don’t save partial and example files with their file extensions, you may not be able to use Antora or Asciidoctor extensions that apply additional behavior to partial or example files. An unpublished file is any file stored in Antora’s standard directory hierarchy that begins with an underscore (_).

This page introduces symlinks and explains how they can be used in Antora to help construct the content hierarchy. A symlink, short for symbolic link, is a shortcut to a file that itself acts like a file. In other words, it’s a file that points to another file. The purpose of a symlink is to give a file a second location without having to duplicate it. A symlink can also point to a directory, which effectively links all the files under that directory to the new location. And a symlink can even point to another symlink, making it possible to give a file or directory even more locations. A symlink acts just like a regular file or directory, albeit with some additional metadata. Applications like Antora that come across a symlink will treat it just like any other file or directory. This property makes symlinks an ideal tool for remapping files, such as examples and partials, into the Antora hierarchy. Before we get into that, let’s look at where symlinks are supported and how to create them. While symlinks were once only common in Unix and Unix-like (*nix) operating systems, in modern computing, support for symlinks is universal. Symlinks can be used on a local filesystem and in a git repository, and they’re translated between the two transparently. In case you’re wondering, yes, symlinks work on Windows too. Since Windows 10, symlinks (and not some imitation) are fully supported on Windows. See Symlinks in Windows 10 to learn about the debut of this capability. A symlink in git is actually different than a symlink on the filesystem for the OS. In git, the symlink is a data file (with a special file mode) that stores a reference to relative path in the repository. When you check out the branch containing the symlink to a worktree (e.g., git clone or git checkout), that reference gets converted to a symlink on the local filesystem. But even if that doesn’t happen (core.symlinks is not enabled), the symlink is created as a regular file that contains the path reference (just like it is in the git repository). A symlink can point to a file, a directory, or even another symlink. When you make a symlink, the relationship should always be expressed as a relative path. If you use an absolute path, it will bind the symlink to the layout of your local filesystem and won’t translate into git. The command you use to make a symlink differs depending on whether you’re using a Unix-like operating system or Windows. However, the result it produces is the same. To make a symlink on a Unix-like operating system (aka *nix), you use the ln command with the -s flag. Here’s an example of how to make a symlink to a sibling file: $ ln -s target.adoc link.adoc In this scenario, link.adoc is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the file target.adoc. This also works for directories (i.e., folders): $ ln -s target link In this scenario, link is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the directory target. The symlink acts as a directory. More often, you’ll want to map to a location outside of the current directory. That means including one or more directory segments in the path of the symlink target. To make a symlink to a file in a directory, first navigate to the directory where you want it to be made. Then, specify the target as the path relative from that directory. This is going to look backwards, but it will create a pointer starting at link and pointing to target. $ ln -s ../../path/to/target.adoc link.adoc In this scenario, link.adoc is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the file ../../path/to/target.adoc relative to the directory containing the symlink. The target could be in a nested directory instead of a parent directory. You can do the same for directories: $ ln -s ../../path/to/target link In this scenario, link is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the directory ../../path/to/target relative to the directory containing the symlink. The symlink acts as a directory. To make a symlink on Windows, you use the mklink command. This command can be used to create a symlink to either a file or a directory. (Using a symlink is preferred over a hard link or a directory junction). To create a symlink to a file, the syntax is as follows: mklink To create a symlink to a directory, the syntax is as follows: mklink /d In Windows, the order of the link and target is reversed when compared to the *nix ln command. Here’s an example of how to make a symlink to a sibling file using mklink: $ mklink link.adoc target.adoc In this scenario, link.adoc is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the file target.adoc. Now let’s create a symlink to a sibling folder. mklink /d link target In this scenario, link is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the directory target. The symlink acts as a directory. More often, you’ll want to link to a location outside of the current directory. That means including one or more directory segments in the path of the symlink target. To make a symlink to a file in a directory, first navigate to the directory where you want it to be made. Then, specify the target as the path relative from that directory. This is going to create a pointer starting at link and pointing to target. $ mklink link.adoc ..\\..\\path\\to\\target.adoc In this scenario, link.adoc is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the file ..\\..\\path\\to\\target.adoc relative to the directory containing the symlink. The target could be in a nested directory instead of a parent directory. You can do the same for directories: $ mklink /d link ..\\..\\path\\to\\target In this scenario, link is a symlink to (i.e., points to) the directory ..\\..\\path\\to\\target relative to the directory containing the symlink. The symlink acts as a directory. Antora fully supports symlinks. That means you can use symlinks in the worktree and you can use symlinks in the git tree. (Yes, git supports symlinks, too). When Antora encounters a symlink to a file, it doesn’t attempt to preserve it as a symlink. Rather, it creates a regular virtual file like it would for any other file it encounters. We can say that within Antora’s virtual file system, the file is duplicated, though it may end up being the only instance if it’s the only part of the symlink under the Antora hierarchy. When Antora encounters a symlink to a directory, it reads all the files under the target directory and creates a regular virtual file for each one. In this case, Antora preserves the path of the symlink, then appends the path to the file from that point. As far as Antora is concerned, the file lives inside the directory represented by the symlink, as though the symlink were a real directory. We can say that within Antora’s virtual file system, all the files under that directory are duplicated, though they may end up being the only instances of those file if the target directory is not part of the Antora hierarchy. The takeaway here is that by using symlinks, you can convince Antora that a file or directory is in a different location than it actually is. If it’s a symlink to a file, Antora treats it as though you copied the file there, except you didn’t. If it’s a symlink to a directory, Antora treats it as though you copied the directory there recursively, except you didn’t. Let’s learn how to make use of this capability. Let’s consider one of the most common uses for the symlink feature in Antora. You have example files you want to include in your documentation, but those files don’t live inside the standard Antora directory structure. In order to make them available to Antora, you need to remap them into the Antora hierarchy. Let’s get a picture of that layout: 📒 docs 📄 antora.yml 📂 modules 📂 ROOT 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 nav.adoc 📒 src 📒 main 📒 java 📒 org 📒 example 📄 MyClass.java What we want to do is include the source file MyClass.java (or some portion of it) in the page index.adoc. However, that’s not currently possible since the source file is not under the Antora hierarchy. Symlinks to the rescue! Start by creating the examples folder under the ROOT module where the symlink will live. 📒 docs 📄 antora.yml 📂 modules 📂 ROOT 📂 examples 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 nav.adoc 📒 src 📒 main 📒 java 📒 org 📒 example 📄 MyClass.java Next, let’s create a symlink from the examples folder to MyClass.java to pull it into the Antora hierarchy. Start by switching to that directory in your terminal. $ cd docs/modules/ROOT/examples Then, create the symlink using the command appropriate for your operating system. *nix $ ln -s ../../../src/main/java/org/example/MyClass.java MyClass.java Windows $ mklink MyClass.java ..\\..\\..\\src\\main\\java\\org\\example\\MyClass.java Here’s the result. 📒 docs 📄 antora.yml 📂 modules 📂 ROOT 📂 examples 🔗 MyClass.java (1) 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 nav.adoc 📒 src 📒 main 📒 java 📒 org 📒 example 📄 MyClass.java 1 MyClass.java is a symlink to the MyClass.java file under src/main/java/org/example at the repository root If you’re sourcing your documentation content from a git reference, commit the symlink to the git repository, just like you would any other file. You can now include the source file in the index.adoc page using the following include directive: include::example$MyClass.java[] You may find it tedious to have to create a symlink for every file you want to include. That’s where directory symlinks come into play. You can create a symlink to a directory, which effectively grafts that hierarchy into the Antora hierarchy. Instead of creating a symlink directory to the source file, let’s create a symlink to the src folder. Again, start by switching to the examples directory. $ cd docs/modules/ROOT/examples Then, create the symlink using the command appropriate for your operating system. *nix $ ln -s ../../../src src Windows $ mklink src ..\\..\\..\\src Here’s the result: 📒 docs 📄 antora.yml 📂 modules 📂 ROOT 📂 examples 🔗 src (1) 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 nav.adoc 📒 src 📒 main 📒 java 📒 org 📒 example 📄 MyClass.java 1 src is a symlink to the src folder at the repository root If you’re sourcing your documentation content from a git reference, commit the symlink to the git repository, just like you would any other file. Even though the symlink points to a directory, in git, it’s still treated like a file. You can now include the source file in the index.adoc page using the following include directive: include::example$src/main/java/org/example/MyClass.java[] You can create symlinks for any type of resource, including examples, partials, pages, images, and so forth. Although the target of the symlink is usually outside of the Antora hierarchy, a symlink can point to a location within the Antora hierarchy if the intent is to duplicate the file or directory. There are some limitations to be aware of when using symlinks in Antora. The target of the symlink must exist. If Antora can’t resolve the symlink, it will throw an error. A symlink can’t point to itself. If Antora detects this scenario, it will throw an error. A symlink in a git repository can’t point to a location outside the git repository. A symlink in a git repository can’t point to a location in another reference in the git repository. The target of the symlink should be relative. Creating a symlink that targets an absolute path has undefined or non-portable behavior. Don’t map a lot of files into the Antora hierarchy that aren’t used in your documentation site. Doing so adds extra processing for Antora that can slow down your build. Be as surgical and precise as you can about which files you map into the Antora hierarchy.","title":"Symlinks","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"symlinks","url":"/antora/3.1/symlinks.html","titles":[{"text":"What is a symlink?","hash":"what-is-a-symlink","id":1},{"text":"Where are symlinks supported?","hash":"where-are-symlinks-supported","id":2},{"text":"How do I make a symlink?","hash":"how-do-i-make-a-symlink","id":3},{"text":"*nix","hash":"nix","id":4},{"text":"Windows","hash":"windows","id":5},{"text":"Symlinks in Antora","hash":"symlinks-in-antora","id":6},{"text":"How does it work?","hash":"how-does-it-work","id":7},{"text":"Remap files using symlinks","hash":"remap-files-using-symlinks","id":8},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"limitations","id":9}]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"The actual version is an identifier, that when combined with a component name, creates a unique identity for a collection of content and source files that are directly related to one another. This collection of source files is a component version. A component version always has an actual version. Even an unversioned component version has an actual version, defined as an empty string, for internal sorting and routing purposes. A component version’s actual version is assigned to the version key in its component version descriptor (antora.yml). Alternatively, the actual version is extracted by Antora from a git refname based on the pattern assigned to the version key in antora.yml or on a content source in a playbook. Content writers use the actual version to reference pages and assets in other component versions. Antora uses the actual version: to sort component versions to identify the latest version of a component to apply routing rules for display purposes in the UI, except when the component version is unversioned as the version segment in the published URLs, except when the component version is unversioned Each version facet—​prerelease, display, and symbolic—​described in the following sections, overrides a default behavior where Antora would otherwise use the actual version. A version of a project or product that is made available before its final release is often called a prerelease version. Organizations use semantic versioning identifiers, such as -alpha.1, or special names, such as M1 or Snapshot, to communicate that a version is a prerelease to end users. To compliment a prerelease version of a project, a component version can be designated as a prerelease using the prerelease key. A component version is designated as a prerelease when the prerelease key is assigned an identifier or the reserved value true in its antora.yml file. Using the prerelease key has the following benefits: While the component version is a prerelease, Antora won’t route incoming page and resource ID references from other component versions to the prerelease version if the version coordinate wasn’t specified or can’t be determined. Instead, Antora routes such references to the latest stable version of the component. The prerelease key allows the actual version (version) of the component version to represent the stable version from the inception of the component version. In other words, the prerelease does not change the actual version. It only modifies its meaning so Antora doesn’t classify it as a stable version. Therefore, the published URLs of the component version and inbound references from other component versions that specifically target the component version aren’t affected when the component version graduates from a prerelease to a stable release. Unless the display_version key is assigned a value or prerelease is assigned true, the prerelease identifier is appended to the actual version and displayed in the UI menus, showing end users that the component version is a prerelease. If the component version is unversioned, only the prerelease identifier is displayed in the UI menus. An actual version can’t contain spaces, uppercase letters, or certain characters that cause processing or portability errors. However, the actual version, when displayed in the UI menus, may not provide the appropriate experience if end users are expecting the version to be displayed with spaces, uppercase letters, or other symbols. In these circumstances, a display version should be assigned to a component version. A display version is an identifier that is only used for presentation purposes in the UI menus. Unlike the actual version, the display version can contain spaces, uppercase letters, and other symbols or characters. The display version is specified using the display_version key in a component version’s antora.yml file. The display version is used by the UI where the version is displayed, including the component version selector and page version selector. The display version is never used in page or resource IDs, for component version routing and sorting, or in the version segment of URLs. A symbolic version or symbolic prerelease version is a value that replaces the actual version in the version segment of a URL. The symbolic version or prerelease version are only applied to the URLs of the latest component version or latest prerelease, respectively. The symbolic version or prerelease version never applies to unversioned component versions. Because the symbolic version and symbolic prerelease version apply to all of the latest component versions or prerelease versions in a site, these values are assigned in your playbook, not in an individual component version’s antora.yml file. The symbolic version is assigned to the latest_version_segment key in the playbook. The symbolic prerelease version is assigned to the latest_prerelease_version_segment key in the playbook. Facet Page and resource IDs Sorting order and routing Menus in reference UI Version segment in URLs Actual Yes Yes Yes Exceptions: If a value is assigned to display_version, the display version is shown instead of the actual version. If prerelease is assigned an identifier and display_version isn’t set, Antora automatically computes a value for display_version by appending the identifier to the actual version. This computed value is shown instead of the actual version. If the component version is unversioned, the actual version is never shown. Instead, the display version, prerelease identifier, or fallback default label is shown depending on the version facets specified in its antora.yml file. Yes Exceptions: If the component version is unversioned, the page and asset URLs don’t contain a version segment.

Node.js 12 and 14 support Antora no longer supports Node.js < 16 (specifically dropping support for Node.js 12 and 14) since those Node.js release lines are now EOL. This change is consistent with Antora’s Node.js support policy. Antora 2 is EOL. Review the checklist on Upgrade Antora to learn about what changes you should make to your source content, including AsciiDoc syntax and Asciidoctor updates introduced in Asciidoctor 2.2, and Antora configuration prior to upgrading to from Antora 2 to Antora 3.1.

The level-0 section title in the document header is referred to as document title, or doctitle for short. The attribute entries in the document header set (or unset) attributes that are available throughout the document. The document title in the AsciiDoc document is used as the page title in Antora. Antora only supports AsciiDoc’s Atx-style heading syntax, which means the page title must be preceded by an Atx marker, an equals sign marker (=) followed by a space. Antora does not recognize the legacy Setext-style (i.e., underlined) heading syntax once supported in AsciiDoc, nor does it recognize Asciidoctor’s Markdown-style heading syntax. If you don’t use the Atx-style syntax, xrefs in the page will not be resolved and other features of AsciiDoc will not be available. Here’s an example of a document header: = Page Title :description: A description of this page. In Antora, all pages must have a page title. That means the doctitle, and thus the document header, is required. See Add a Title and Metadata for more information about specifying a page title. If you need to apply a unique set of CSS to a page, you can add a role to the doctitle, as shown here. = Home Page :docrole: home Assuming the UI you’re using supports it, you can now use the body.home selector to configure CSS to target this specific page. Header attributes are document-wide AsciiDoc attributes that are associated with the document header, and thus the document metadata. Some header attributes can be used to control the processing of the page, such as page-toclevels. More commonly, header attributes are used to store reusable inline content for the document. The document header implicitly ends at the first empty line. Therefore, any attribute entries below this line will not be treated as header attributes. There are several built-in header attributes you can use to control the metadata in the published page. See Add a Title and Metadata to learn about these attributes. Header attributes can be promoted to page attributes by prefixing the name with page-. Page Attributes are accessible from the UI model in the page layout template and can thus control how the page is formed.","title":"Document Header","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"document-header","url":"/antora/3.1/asciidoc/document-header.html","titles":[{"text":"Document title","hash":"document-title","id":1},{"text":"Header attributes","hash":"header-attributes","id":2}]},"82":{"id":82,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: How to embed a YouTube or Vimeo video in a page.

External URLs are links to webpages that aren’t built as part of your documentation site by your Antora pipeline. When you want to link to a page, image, or attachment that is part of your documentation site, use the AsciiDoc xref macro and the resource’s resource ID instead. To create a link to an external URL, all you need to do is add the URL prefixed with its scheme. Raw URL syntax Chat with other documentation writers at https://chat.antora.org. Links that begin with official schemes, such as https, ftp, mailto, etc., are automatically turned into hyperlinks when they’re processed. Here’s the result of Raw URL syntax.

A URL may not display correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (_) or carets (^) because these characters get interpreted as text formatting markup. There are two ways to solve this situation. Option 1: Create a custom attribute for the URL. Option 2: Use the inline pass macro with macros enabled. Let’s make an attribute for a complex URL. Creating an attribute for a URL is also a good strategy when the URL is long; it keeps the source text clean for writers and editors. Example 3.

AsciiDoc is ideal for writing documentation because it’s: readable concise comprehensive extensible easy to learn This area of the documentation is intended to provide a preliminary introduction to the AsciiDoc Language and highlight some of the syntax that you’ll use in Antora on a daily basis. These pages should not be considered an authoritative or canonical reference for the language. To find the official user documentation for the AsciiDoc Language, please visit the AsciiDoc Language documentation. If there’s a discrepancy between what’s written here and in the linked documentation, the linked documentation takes precedence. AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language that supports all the structural and semantic elements necessary for writing technical documentation. The AsciiDoc syntax is intuitive because it recognizes well-established, plain text conventions for marking up and structuring text. A person unfamiliar with AsciiDoc should be able to figure out the purpose of most of its syntax elements just by looking at them. That’s because the syntax elements were carefully chosen to look like what they mean. AsciiDoc only requires a text editor to read or write, thereby offering a very low bar to get started. Asciidoctor.js is the processor that converts AsciiDoc content to HTML and other formats. No coverage of Asciidoctor is complete without mention of its speed. It loads, parses, and converts documents extremely quickly. That’s good news for teams and applications that need to process thousands of documentation files in multiple environments on a daily basis. Asciidoctor also offers several levels of security, further justifying its suitability for server-side deployments. The Asciidoctor project, home to the AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor.js, and its extensions, is open source and made available under the MIT license. The Antora developers are also the lead Asciidoctor maintainers, which helps ensures a tight integration and keeps both technologies moving forward to address ever-changing documentation requirements and needs.","title":"AsciiDoc","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"index","url":"/antora/3.1/asciidoc/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Syntax","hash":"syntax","id":1},{"text":"Parser","hash":"parser","id":2},{"text":"Speed and security","hash":"speed-and-security","id":3},{"text":"The advantages of Open Source","hash":"the-advantages-of-open-source","id":4}]},"88":{"id":88,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: How to italicize text in AsciiDoc.

Ordered list item .... Another ordered list item + (1) term:: A description list term and content. 1 A list continuation is a plus symbol (+) on a line by itself that is immediately adjacent to the block being attached. To add additional paragraphs or blocks to a list item, you must attach them with a list continuation (+). Here’s how the complex list above is rendered. A list item can contain two or more paragraphs or blocks of content. artifacts: expire_in: 1 week An example block A literal paragraph doesn’t require a list continuation. $ antora antora-playbook.yml You can also mix list item types in the same list.

Alternatively, when a list item contains multiple blocks, you can wrap them in a delimited open block (--). Then you only need a single list continuation line to attach the open block to the list item. Example 3.

How to specify a source language for a source block. How to specify a global source language using source-language. How to disable syntax highlighting for source blocks. An AsciiDoc source code block, or source block for short, displays snippets of content that are written in a given programming, data, configuration, or markup language. The content of a source block is colorized using a syntax highlighter when it’s rendered in a site. A source block is created by assigning the attribute source and the name of a valid source language to a block. The style source is a positional element attribute. It’s assigned to a block using the first position in an attribute list. Example 1. Directly assign source and a source language using an attribute list [source,name-of-language] (1) 1 An attribute list with source assigned to the first position and a source language name, such as bash, cpp, etc., assigned to the second position. The name of a source language is assigned to the second position in an attribute list or using the source-language document attribute. The source language is the name of a programming, data, configuration, or markup language in which the block’s content is written. Specifying a source language serves two purposes. First, it communicates to the site visitor which language runtime or data format reader is needed to interpret the code displayed in the block. Second, it allows a syntax highlighter to colorize the source content properly, such as emphasizing language types and keywords. Finally, by assigning a language to a block, you can implicitly assign source to the block at the same time. As shown in Example 2, by assigning the name of a valid source language to the second position of an attribute list, you implicitly assign source to the first position. Example 2. Assign a source language to the second position of an attribute list [,name-of-language] (1) 1 To assign a source language to the second position of an attribute list without assigning source directly to the first position, enter a comma (,) immediately after the opening square bracket, then enter the name of a source language. The language name is written in lowercase letters and must be a language recognized by the syntax highlighter Antora uses for the content to be colorized correctly. If most of your source blocks use the same language, you can assign the name of the language to the source-language document attribute. When source is specified but a language isn’t specified in the attribute list of a source block or by the source-language document attribute, Antora applies the language none at runtime. The block is styled like other source blocks, but no syntax highlighting will be applied to its content. Source blocks are most often created from delimited listing and literal blocks as well as paragraphs. A block becomes a source block in the following scenarios: a language name is assigned to the second position in a block’s attribute list, which implicitly assigns source to the first position in the attribute list source is assigned directly to the first position in a block’s attribute list, and a language name is assigned to the second position or to the source-language document attribute the document attribute source-language is set, which automatically promotes all delimited listing blocks that aren’t assigned another style to source blocks When source is assigned to a block using any of these methods, the content of the block is colorized according to the assigned source language by the syntax highlighter. Because source is assigned to a block using the first position of an attribute list, you can assign it implicitly by entering a comma (,) directly after the opening bracket, followed by the name of a source language. The comma is required, otherwise the language would be assigned to the first position of the attribute list. Example 3 shows the source attribute being applied implicitly to a listing block. Example 3. Apply source implicitly to a listing block [,name-of-language] (1) --(2) Content of source block (3) Content of source block Content of source block --(4) 1 Directly after the opening square bracket ([) of the attribute list, enter a comma (,), followed by the name of the source language in which the block’s content is written. Complete the attribute list with a closing square bracket (]) and select Enter to go to the next line. 2 On the new line directly below the attribute list, enter the opening delimiter of a listing block (----) and then select Enter to go to the next line. 3 On the lines below the opening delimiter, insert your code snippet. 4 On a new line, enter the closing delimiter of the listing block (----). You can use source implicitly on other block types to create a source block. Example 4 shows the source attribute being applied implicitly to a paragraph. Example 4. Apply source style to a paragraph A regular paragraph. [,name-of-language] (1) Content of source block (2) A regular paragraph. 1 After the opening square bracket ([) of the attribute list, enter a comma (,), followed by the name of the source language in which the block’s content is written. Complete the attribute list with a closing square bracket (]) and select Enter to go to the next line. 2 On the line directly below the attribute list, enter the block’s content on one or more continuous lines. In Example 5, source is assigned implicitly and haskell is assigned as the language. Example 5. Assign source and the language haskell to a block [,haskell] ---- main :: IO () main = putStrLn \"Hello, World!\" ---- Example 6 shows how the source block appears when displayed in a site. Example 6. Rendered source block with syntax highlighting applied main :: IO () main = putStrLn \"Hello, World!\" The content in Example 6 is colorized, and when you hover over the block, the language name HASKELL appears in its upper right corner. In some cases, you may prefer to assign source directly to a block. In a block’s attribute list, source is entered in the first position in the list, followed by a comma (,), and then the name of a language, such as clojure, json, xml, etc. Example 7 shows the source attribute being applied directly to a delimited literal block (....). Example 7. Apply source style directly to a block [source,name-of-language] (1) .... Content of source block Content of source block Content of source block .... 1 In the attribute list, assign source to the first position, followed by a comma (,), and then the name of the source language in which the block’s content is written. In Example 8, source is assigned to the first position and sql is assigned as the language to the second position. Example 8. Assign source and the language sql to a block [source,sql] ---- IF EXISTS (SELECT name FROM myobjects WHERE name = 'hello') ---- Example 9 shows how the source block appears when displayed in a site. Example 9. Rendered source block with syntax highlighting applied IF EXISTS (SELECT name FROM myobjects WHERE name = 'hello') The content in Example 9 is colorized, and when you hover over the block, the language name SQL appears in the upper right corner. To assign an element ID, role, or option to a source block using their applicable shorthand syntax, specify the source attribute and append the ID, role, or options to the attribute. Example 10 shows the source attribute and an element ID being assigned to a listing block. Example 10. Assign an element ID to a source block [#element-id,name-of-language] (1) (2) ---- Content of source block Content of source block ---- 1 In the attribute list, specify the element ID in the first position. An element ID is directly appended to the style (which is empty in this case) using the hash symbol (#) followed by the ID name. The source style is implied since a language is specified in the second position. 2 Directly after the element ID, enter a comma (,), and then the name of the source language in which the block’s content is written. Now let’s look at a source block that’s created with a delimited literal block and is assigned an element ID using the shorthand hash symbol (#). In Example 11, an element ID is appended to the implicit source style with a #. The line comparison syntax, diff, is assigned to the second position. Example 11. Assign source, an element ID, and the language diff to a block [#temper-change,diff] .... - temperDestination(destination) + if (destination instanceof Boom) moderateDestination(destination) } rootLoggerHolder.set(undefined, addFailOnExitHooks(logger, failureLevel)) .... Example 12 shows how the source block appears when displayed in a site. Example 12. Rendered source block with syntax highlighting applied - temperDestination(destination) + if (destination instanceof Boom) moderateDestination(destination) } rootLoggerHolder.set(undefined, addFailOnExitHooks(logger, failureLevel)) The content in Example 12 is colorized, and when you hover over the block, the language name DIFF appears in the upper right corner of the block. You can define a source language globally, either at the page, component version, or site level, by setting the source-language document attribute. When source-language is set, all delimited listing blocks that aren’t assigned a style are automatically promoted to source blocks. The source-language attribute is set and assigned a value in the document header of a page, component version descriptor file, or playbook. In Example 13, the source-language attribute is set in the header of a page and assigned the name of a language. Example 13. Set source-language in the document header = Title of Page :source-language: name-of-language (1) A paragraph. --(2) Content of source block --(2) A paragraph. .... (3) Content of a literal block. .... (3) 1 On a new line in the header of the page, set the built-in document attribute source-language and assign it the name of a language as a value. 2 Because source-language is set, this listing block is automatically promoted to a source block. 3 This literal block remains a literal block. Only listing blocks are automatically promoted to source blocks when source-language is set. When source-language is set, you may want some listing blocks to not be promoted to source blocks or to assign a different language to a few of them. Example 14 shows how to prevent a listing block from being promoted to a source block and how to override the language assigned to the source-language attribute. Example 14. Override source-language on select blocks = Title of Page :source-language: java (1) A paragraph. --(2) Content of source block --(2) A paragraph. [listing] (3) ---- Content of listing block ---- [,yaml] (4) ---- Content of source block ---- 1 The document attribute source-language is set in the header of the page and assigned the value java. All of the listing blocks on this page that aren’t directly assigned a style will be promoted to source blocks and all source blocks that aren’t directly assigned a source language will be assigned the language java. 2 This listing block is automatically promoted to a source block and assigned the language java. It’s content will be identified as JAVA and colorized accordingly. 3 This listing block is assigned the style listing, therefore it isn’t promoted to a source block and its contents will not be colorized. 4 This source block is directly assigned the language yaml. Therefore, the block’s content will be identified as YAML and colorized accordingly. We’ll look at how colorization gets added in the next section. Syntax highlighting is a technique of colorizing the code to make it easier to read by emphasizing types, keywords, and other language constructs. Syntax highlighting of source blocks is enabled using the source-highlighter attribute. Antora sets source-highlighter site-wide by default (see site and configuration attributes), therefore, you don’t need to do anything to enable this feature. Antora uses highlight.js to automatically add syntax highlighting to source blocks that specify a source language. Syntax highlighting also requires a contribution from the UI. The reference Antora UI bundles the highlight.js library (both the JavaScript and the CSS) and adds it to each page. The names of the languages that are currently supported are listed in the highlight.bundle.js file in Antora’s UI repository. You can disable or override the source-highlighter attribute in the playbook or a component version descriptor. To disable syntax highlighting, unset the source-highlighter attribute in your playbook. Example 15. Disable source-highlighter attribute in antora-playbook.yml asciidoc: attributes: source-highlighter: ~ Currently, the only source-highlighter value Antora supports when using the reference UI is highlight.js. If you set the value to rouge, pygments, or coderay, Antora will fail. That’s because these built-in, build-time syntax highlighters are not available in the Antora environment (and specifically Asciidoctor.js). You can use other client-side (also known as browser) libraries, such as prettify or prism. However, to use them, you’ll need to modify the UI to bundle and add the library to each page, like the reference UI does for highlight.js. In the future, it will be possible to register additional adapters to plug in other syntax highlighters. However, that feature is not currently available in Antora. The content of a source block is often inserted using an include directive.

Italic Text is often italicized in order to stress a word or phrase, quote a speaker, or introduce a term. Italic type slants slightly to the right, and depending on the font, may have cursive swashes and flourishes. Monospace Technical content often requires text to be styled in a way that indicates a command or source code. Such text is usually emphasized using a fixed-width (i.e., monospace) font.

The Antora command line interface (Antora CLI) is a simple tool (named antora) that enables you to execute and optionally configure Antora and any registered extended components and extensions from the command prompt of your terminal application. Antora’s CLI is the primary user-facing entry point for Antora. Therefore, you’ll frequently see it referenced in the documentation as the recommended way to interact with Antora. If you aren’t familiar with the command line, the CLI Primer provides a basic overview of command anatomy, navigating working directories, and terminal application concepts. By default, Antora looks in the provided playbook for its configuration settings. When using the Antora CLI, you can specify optional configuration overrides as necessary using CLI options or environment variables. When you interact with a CLI, you type a command into the prompt of your terminal application, then press Enter to execute it. The command consists of the program name (or program path) followed by zero or more options and arguments. In the next few sections, we’ll break down these parts for the Antora CLI. For certain programs, like Antora, a command can also refer to the primary argument of the program. This can be confusing because you’ll see the term command used to represent two distinct concepts. One is the whole command you type at the prompt and the other is the program’s primary argument. Every command starts with the base call (i.e., program name or path). antora base call $ antora In the case of the Antora CLI, the base call is antora. This assumes that the Antora CLI is available on the PATH (e.g., installed globally). Otherwise, the base call must be the path to the antora bin script (e.g., npx antora). The base call must be offset from any command (for the program), options, or arguments by at least one space. If you run the base call without specifying any command, options, or arguments, as shown in antora base call, you will be presented with a usage statement (i.e., help text). Usage statement $ antora Usage: antora [options] [[command] [args]] A modular, single or multi-repository documentation site generator for AsciiDoc. Options: -v, --version Output the version of the CLI and default site generator. -r, --require Require library (aka node module) or script before executing command. --stacktrace Print the stacktrace to the console if the application fails. -h, --help Output usage information. Commands: generate [options] Generate a documentation site specified in . Run 'antora --help' to see options and examples for a command (e.g., antora generate --help). Windows troubleshooting You may get the message “running scripts is disabled” when running the antora command in Powershell. If you do, you can work around this problem by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine An alternate workaround is to run Antora using the Windows Command Prompt. The usage statement provides an overview of the antora program, which includes: the command syntax, a description, a list of global options, a list of commands, and a suggestion for how to request additional help. The usage statement begins with the following hint: Usage: antora [options] [[command] [args]] That’s the cue to learn more about the options, commands, and args (i.e., arguments) it recognizes. The commands supported by the Antora CLI are summarized in the following table. In this context, the term command refers to the primary argument accepted by the antora base call (as opposed to the command as a whole). Command Purpose generate Generates a site using the specified playbook file. Antora runs generate automatically with the default Antora pipeline unless an alternate command is specified. The command requires the path to a playbook file, relative to the working directory, be specified in the command’s only argument. help Outputs the usage statement for the Antora CLI. Note that this command is not shown in the usage statement. version Outputs the version number of the Antora CLI. Note that this command is not shown in the usage statement. help and version are meta commands that show information about the Antora CLI itself. The Antora CLI currently only supports one functional command, which is generate. Since generate is the primary function of the Antora CLI, you don’t have to specify it explicitly. The generate command will always be implied if no command is specified (unless you execute the base call by itself). The simplest way to execute Antora using the Antora CLI is to specify the required base call (antora) followed by the path to a playbook file, as shown in antora base call with playbook argument. antora base call with playbook argument $ antora antora-playbook.yml You’ve learned that the generate command is implied if not present. Therefore, antora base call with playbook argument is equivalent to the command shown in antora base call with explicit command and playbook argument. antora base call with explicit command and playbook argument $ antora generate antora-playbook.yml Let’s break down this command: The command assumes that the Antora CLI is available on the PATH (e.g., installed globally). Otherwise, it would be necessary to replace antora with the path to the antora bin script (e.g., npx antora). The base call, antora, tells the Antora CLI to run, which reads the remaining command and argument. The command specified (implicitly or explicitly) is generate. You don’t see the command in antora base call with playbook argument because it’s optional, but Antora implies it’s there if not present. The options and arguments that follow the command apply to the command, so control changes hands to the command at this point. The generate command requires an explicit argument that specifies the filesystem path of a playbook file relative to the current working directory. In antora base call with playbook argument, the relative filesystem path to the playbook file is antora-playbook.yml. That is, the command is being executed from the same directory where the playbook file is located. The generate command, whether implicit or explicitly entered, requires an argument that specifies the filesystem path of a playbook file relative to the current working directory. For the next example, let’s use a playbook file named antora-playbook.yml that’s located in home/my-projects/a-project/docs-site. As shown directly before the command prompt ($) in Specify a playbook located in the working directory, the working directory is docs-site. That means the processes associated with the antora and generate commands as well as the playbook argument will be interpreted relative to docs-site. Since the playbook file, antora-playbook.yml, happens to be located in the working directory, only the playbook’s file name needs to be specified. Specify a playbook located in the working directory docs-site $ antora antora-playbook.yml When the playbook isn’t stored in the working directory, the playbook argument must include the path relative to the working directory or the full path to the playbook file from the filesystem’s root directory. The working directory in Specify the filesystem path to the playbook is my-projects. The playbook file is stored in home/my-projects/a-project/docs-site. Specify the filesystem path to the playbook my-projects $ antora a-project/docs-site/antora-playbook.yml In Specify the filesystem path to the playbook, the playbook’s filesystem path relative to the working directory is entered as the command’s sole argument. The file extension of the playbook doesn’t need to be specified. Antora auto-detects the file extension as long as the playbook argument includes the file’s stem (e.g., antora-playbook). The playbook argument in Auto-detection of the playbook file extension doesn’t have a file extension, so Antora will look for a file matching the playbook’s file stem relative to the working directory. Auto-detection of the playbook file extension docs-site $ antora antora-playbook Antora’s search order for playbook file formats is YAML, then JSON, and then TOML. You can see more examples of the antora and generate commands in Run Antora. If you’ve read this whole page, you already know how to display the main help text for the Antora CLI. Just type antora by itself and press Enter. But there’s a more idiomatic way to do it. The Antora CLI accepts options. One such option is the help option, -h or --help. This option will short-circuit the execution of the program and instead display the usage statement. The usage statement contains information about the program and its commands, options, and arguments. The command in Display help for the antora base call will display help for the antora program. Display help for the antora base call $ antora -h Another way to display the help is to use the implicit help command: $ antora help As suggested at the end of the usage statement, you can also display help for the generate command by including the name of the command to the base call and moving the -h option after it. Display help for the generate command $ antora generate -h You can also write this command using the implicit help command: $ antora help generate There are many more options supported by the Antora CLI, which are covered in CLI Options.","title":"Antora CLI Commands","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"index","url":"/antora/3.1/cli/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s the Antora CLI?","hash":"whats-the-antora-cli","id":1},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":2},{"text":"Commands","hash":"commands","id":3},{"text":"generate command","hash":"generate-command","id":4},{"text":"Specify a playbook","hash":"specify-playbook","id":5},{"text":"Playbook file extension","hash":"playbook-file-extension","id":6},{"text":"Display the Antora CLI help","hash":"help","id":7}]},"101":{"id":101,"text":"You can configure the behavior of the Antora CLI and various playbook keys directly from your terminal using command line options.

You can specify multiple options to a command. A command must start with the antora base call and end with the playbook file argument.

Pass multiple options to the CLI $ antora --ui-bundle-url ./../ui-bundle.zip --redirect-facility nginx --clean antora-playbook In Pass multiple options to the CLI, the option --ui-bundle-url is assigned a value that specifies a local filesystem path relative to the working directory. The --redirect-facility is assigned the built-in value nginx. The boolean option, --clean, is enabled by entering its name without a value. Some options can be specified multiple times. These are keys that correspond to a map of values. Examples include --key and --attribute. Each value must be preceded by the option’s flag. Specify an option multiple times $ antora --key support=587tyr999 --key tracer=ID-${spawn} antora-playbook In Specify an option multiple times, the --key option has been assigned two values in the form name=value. There are two ways to assign a value to an option. The option flag and its value can be written with a single space between them: --option value. Or, it can be written using an equals sign (=) between the option flag and the value: --option=value. Which form you choose is a personal preference. To assign an empty value, you must use the form --option '' or --option=. You cannot use the form --option by itself as this will be interpreted as a boolean option. In Assign a value to an option, the option --to-dir is assigned the value prod. When Antora runs, a folder named prod will be created relative to the working directory and the site files written to it. Assign a value to an option $ antora --to-dir prod antora-playbook Values that contain spaces must be surrounded by quotation marks: --option 'Value with Spaces' or --option='Value with Spaces'. In Assign a value containing spaces to an option, the option title is assigned the value My Docs. The generated site’s title will be My Docs.

The Antora CLI accepts command inputs in the form of a base call, a command (for the program), options, and arguments. Once entered in a terminal, the command is executed using the specified inputs. $ antora [options] base call The Antora CLI command starts with the base call, which is the name of the program (i.e., antora). This tells the command interpreter to execute the Antora CLI. If the system cannot find the program name by itself, you must specify the path to the antora bin script instead (e.g., npx antora). command A command tells Antora what operation to perform. Only one command can be specified at a time. option One or more options can be specified after a command. The full name of an option is prefixed with two hyphens (--); a shorthand name is prefixed with one hyphen (-). Some options toggle behavior on or off and others accept values. Options that accept values can be written using a single space between the option’s name and value (--option value) or using an equals sign between the name and value (--option=value). argument An argument is entered after the base call and any options. You can think of an argument as an anonymous options. The generate command only accepts a single argument, which is the path to the playbook file. environment variable Environment variables (which are not present in the command itself) are read from your terminal’s state. An environment variable overrides the corresponding key in the playbook file, but is itself overridden by the corresponding CLI option. If you’re new to terminal applications, here are the common conventions used in this documentation that represent a terminal and describe how you’ll interact with it. Prompt ($) The terminal command prompt is shown as a dollar sign ($) in the examples throughout this documentation. The prompt you see when you open your terminal depends on the terminal application you use. Don’t include the $ prompt when you type or copy commands. Working directory Every command is run from a current working directory. The processes associated with a command’s inputs are interpreted relative to the working directory. Your current working directory is often displayed directly to the left of the terminal’s command prompt ($), however, this is dependent on the terminal application you’re using and how its configured. A few examples in this documentation show the name of the working directory in front of the prompt as a helpful hint. name-of-working-directory $ antora antora-playbook Don’t include this text or the prompt when copying the command. Replaceable input Many options are defined according to your content, environment, and site requirements. Some command line examples in this documentation call out the input you define with a set of angle brackets (). The text inside the brackets describes the input or represents a common input format, e.g., --require , --title ''. When composing the command in your terminal, replace the representative text with your input and don’t enclose it in angle brackets (). Command output If a command returns information, the output is displayed in your terminal on the lines beneath the executed command. The command prompt ($) is not displayed on the output lines.","title":"CLI Primer","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"primer","url":"/antora/3.1/cli/primer.html","titles":[{"text":"Command inputs and structure","hash":"command-inputs-and-structure","id":1},{"text":"Terminal conventions","hash":"terminal-conventions","id":2}]},"103":{"id":103,"text":"The bulk of the work of an Antora extension is done by the event listeners. An event listener is a function that’s called whenever an event it’s listening for is emitted. Any value returned by the listener is ignored. The register function is responsible for associating these listener functions with particular events. It does so by passing the event name and the listener function to the on method of the generator context, called adding a listener. The API of the generator context follows that of a Node.js EventEmitter. Let’s build on the extension we have defined by updating it to add an event listener. We’ll listen for the playbookBuilt and sitePublished events, which are the first and last events to be emitted by the generator. This gives us the opportunity to roughly measure how long it took to generate and publish the site. Example 1. time-generation-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this .on('playbookBuilt', () => { console.time('generation time') }) .on('sitePublished', () => { console.timeEnd('generation time') }) } In Example 1, we use the on method of the generator context to add two listeners, one for when the playbookBuilt event is emitted and one for when the sitePublished event is emitted. The on method returns the generator context, so we can use it to chain calls, as show in the previous example. Since built-in events are only emitted once, you can register the listener for a built-in event using once instead of on. this.once('playbookBuilt', () => { ... }) Using once provides a very slight optimization. It allows the event emitter to deactivate itself once there are no more listeners remaining. By default, listeners are invoked in the order they are added. To guarantee our timer starts before listeners from other extensions are called, our playbookBuilt listener should be called before other listeners of the playbookBuilt event and our sitePublished listener should be called after other listeners of the sitePublished event. There are two changes we must make to get this to work. First, we can use the prependListener method as an alternative to on to add the playbookBuilt listener before other listeners that have already been associated with that event. Example 2. time-generation-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this .prependListener('playbookBuilt', () => { console.time('generation time') }) .on('sitePublished', () => { console.timeEnd('generation time') }) } Second, we should list our extension last in the playbook. Taking these two steps ensures our timer runs around all other listeners. If you want to time a specific stage of the generator, you can update this extension to listen to other generator events. To extend the timer all the way to when Node.js exits, you can listen for the exit event on the Node.js process object. process.on('exit', () => { console.timeEnd('generation time') }) To learn more about the exit event and other events emitted by the Node.js process, see Node.js process events. The EventEmitter API, which the generator context inherits, also allows listeners to be retrieved, removed, and added again. That opens up the possibility that one extension can rearrange listeners added by other extensions, if the need arises. Extensions can also emit and listen for custom events using the same methods. To do something more interesting than time the execution and print messages to the console, we need to use context variables. Let’s learn how that’s done next.","title":"Add Event Listeners","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"add-event-listeners","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/add-event-listeners.html","titles":[]},"104":{"id":104,"text":"Antora calls listeners synchronously in the order they are registered. This is true even if a listener is marked asynchronous using the async keyword or the listener returns a Promise. Antora will await the completion of the listener invocation before calling the next listener (and thus before continuing its own operation). This behavior differs from the behavior of the built-in NodeEmitter in Node.js. The benefit of marking a listener as async, or returning a Promise, is that the listener can perform asynchronous operations. Of course, these operations will all be resolved before Antora proceeds, so they are made to behave in a synchronous fashion outside the boundaries of the function. A Promise ends when the program calls await on it. Obviously, that requirement bubbles all the way up to the top-level function of the program. Antora hides away this detail by allowing you to either define an extension listener as async or return a Promise. Let’s look at an example of fetching a file from a URL and publishing it to the site. Example 1. fetch-and-publish-readme-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on('beforePublish', async ({ siteCatalog }) => { const https = require('https') const contents = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const buffer = [] https .get('https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/raw/HEAD/README.adoc', (response) => { response.on('data', (chunk) => buffer.push(chunk.toString())) response.on('end', () => resolve(buffer.join('').trimRight())) }) .on('error', reject) }) siteCatalog.addFile({ contents: Buffer.from(contents), out: { path: 'README.adoc' } }) }) } Notice that we have added the async keyword to the listener function. This allows us to the use the await keyword inside the function. As an exercise, you could try retrieving a file from each branch of each content source and adding it to the published site. To give you a hint, you would need to access the playbook variable to get a list of content sources. If you don’t want Antora to wait for the completion of your asynchronous listener, you can either return an empty promise (e.g, return Promise.resolve()), or you can remove the async keyword from your listener. However, if you do so, you’ll need to add a listener that listens for an event that is emitted later in the generator, such as contextClosed, so you can resolve the promise before Antora completes. Let’s look at the same example as earlier, except it downloads the README.adoc in the background while the site is being generated. To help manage the state of the pending promise, it has also been rewritten as a class-based extension. Example 2. background-fetch-and-publish-readme-extension.js const https = require('https') class FetchAndPublishReadmeExtension { static register ({ config }) { return new FetchAndPublishReadmeExtension(this, config) } constructor (context, config) { ;(this.context = context) .on('playbookBuilt', this.onPlaybookBuilt.bind(this)) .on('beforePublish', this.onBeforePublish.bind(this)) this.readmeUrl = config.readmeUrl || 'https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/raw/HEAD/README.adoc' this.contentsPromise = undefined } playbookBuilt ({ siteCatalog }) { this.contentsPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const buffer = [] https .get(this.readmeUrl, (response) => { response.on('data', (chunk) => buffer.push(chunk.toString())) response.on('end', () => resolve(buffer.join('').trimRight())) }) .on('error', reject) }) } async onBeforePublish ({ siteCatalog }) { const contents = await this.contentsPromise siteCatalog.addFile({ contents: Buffer.from(contents), out: { path: 'README.adoc' } }) } } module.exports = FetchAndPublishReadmeExtension Notice that only the onBeforePublish listener function is async so it can wait for the promise started by the onPlaybookBuilt listener function. The extension also now accepts the URL of the README as a configuration key named readme_url.","title":"Asynchronous Listeners","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"asynchronous-listeners","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/asynchronous-listeners.html","titles":[]},"105":{"id":105,"text":"If your extension is going to listen for multiple events and keep track of state, you may want to consider defining your extension as a JavaScript class. A class is a template for creating an object. It encapsulates both data and the methods that operate on that data. This encapsulation can help keep your extension more organized. The challenge is to work out how to define a class in such a way that it can be used as an Antora extension. This page shows you how. The basic structure of a class-based extension is as follows: Define a class named after your extension (e.g., MyExtension) Add a static register method that Antora can call Define listeners as instance methods (e.g., onPlaybookBuilt ({ playbook })) Add a constructor that accepts the generator context and registers listeners from the class Export the class definition Here’s the skeleton of our extension class: class MyExtension { } Let’s fill in the details. Antora won’t create an instance of your class, but you can use the static register method on the class to do so. If you’re coming from Java, you can think of it like the main method of the class. Here’s how that entry point looks: class MyExtension { static register () { new MyExtension(this) } } module.exports = MyExtension All Antora will see is the register method on the exported class definition, which Antora will invoke to get the process started. The remainder of the work happens in the extension instance. Notice how the static register method has transitioned us from a static function to an instance of the extension class. The register method passes the generator context to constructor of the extension class so it can access and store a reference to it. Listeners are defined as methods on the extension class. They will get invoked just like any other listener function, only they will have a reference to both the current instance of the class (this) and the generator context (this.context). That way, they can access both properties on the extension (extension state) and context variables in the generator. Here’s the extension class again with the listeners defined as methods: class MyExtension { static register () { new MyExtension(this) } onPlaybookBuilt () { this.startTime = +new Date } onSitePublished () { const elapsed = (+new Date - this.startTime) / 1000 const logger = this.context.getLogger('my-extension') logger.info(`elapsed time: ${elapsed}s`) } } module.exports = MyExtension Now all that’s left is to wire these listeners to events. The next step is to create a constructor the accepts the generator context and adds listeners. Here’s the extension class again with the constructor: class MyExtension { static register () { new MyExtension(this) } constructor (generatorContext) { ;(this.context = generatorContext) .on('playbookBuilt', this.onPlaybookBuilt.bind(this)) .on('sitePublished', this.onSitePublished.bind(this)) } onPlaybookBuilt () { this.startTime = +new Date } onSitePublished () { const elapsed = (+new Date - this.startTime) / 1000 const logger = this.context.getLogger('my-extension') logger.info(`elapsed time: ${elapsed}s`) } } module.exports = MyExtension When adding each listener, it must be bound to the extension instance (i.e., this). Otherwise, the listeners won’t be able to access the properties on the extension instance. The listener can still access the generator context using the context property, to which the constructor assigns the generator context. As you have seen, using a class-based extension can keep your extension code more organized. It also allows your extension to take advantages of other object-oriented patterns, such as inheritance, composition, and delegation.","title":"Class-Based Extension","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"class-based-extension","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/class-based-extension.html","titles":[{"text":"Extension class structure","hash":"extension-class-structure","id":1},{"text":"The register method and instantiation","hash":"the-register-method-and-instantiation","id":2},{"text":"Listener methods","hash":"listener-methods","id":3},{"text":"The constructor and adding listeners","hash":"the-constructor-and-adding-listeners","id":4}]},"106":{"id":106,"text":"An extension that you write or use may require additional settings to configure its behavior. While the extension could tap into information already available in the playbook or the content sources Antora is building, it may be necessary to configure the extension directly. An extension can accept an arbitrary number of properties, which may be nested, that are specified in the entry in the playbook file. These properties are accessible via a context variable named config that’s passed to the extension’s register function. Let’s assume that we want to publish a file named humans.txt to give credit to the people who make the documentation site possible. We’ll name our extension humans-txt-extension.js. Of course, the extension won’t know who to credit, so we’ll need to pass it some configuration. Let’s start by registering our new extension in the playbook and passing in the list of people using the names key. The value of this key will be an array of names. antora: extensions: - require: ./humans-txt-extension.js names: - Doc Writer - Dr. Austen - Emily Story To make room for the additional keys, we’ve converted the entry for the extension from a single (string) value to a map. The require request value slides into the require key. That leaves room to define additional keys, in this case names. Now let’s write an extension that accepts this configuration and uses it to create the humans.txt file: Example 1. humans-txt-extension.js module.exports.register = function ({ config }) { this.on('beforePublish', ({ siteCatalog }) => { const teamInfo = '/* TEAM */\\n' + config.names.map((name) => `Name: ${name}`).join('\\n') const contents = Buffer.from(teamInfo + '\\n') siteCatalog.addFile({ contents, out: { path: 'humans.txt' } }) }) } The config object for the extension is accessed using object destructuring just like any other context variable. Thanks to variable scoping in JavaScript, we can still access that variable in our listener for the beforePublish event. We use the information it provides to populate the contents of the humans.txt file and add it to the site catalog. Antora will then include humans.txt file in the published site. In YAML, key names use the snake_case naming convention. In JavaScript, property names use the camelCase naming convention. To help bridge the naming convention mismatch between YAML and JavaScript, Antora automatically transforms snake_case key names in the playbook file into camelCase properties on the configuration object. For example, Antora transforms cache_dir to cacheDir. Most of the time, this isn’t a problem. However, if your extension passes configuration or data on to another application, this transformation can be problematic. To bypass this configuration, you can tuck keys away inside the data key. Any keys inside the data key (at any depth) are passed through without being modified. Let’s assume that we want to specify structured content for our humans.txt file. We don’t need Antora to transform this structured content, so we can store it inside a key named data. antora: extensions: - require: ./humans-txt-extension.js data: TEAM: - Lead Writer: Doc Writer Contact: doc [at] example.org Location: Denver, CO - Information Architect: Dr. Austen Location: Winchester, Hampshire, England - Narrator: Emily Story Location: Antwerp, Belgium Now, the extension can iterate over the keys in config.data and layout the contents of the humans.txt file. const contents = Buffer.from( Object.entries(config.data).reduce((accum, [category, entries]) => { if (accum.length) accum.push('') accum.push(`/* ${category} */`) entries.forEach((entry) => { accum.push('') for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(entry)) accum.push(`${key}: ${val}`) }) return accum }, []).join('\\n') )","title":"Configure an Extension","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"configure-extension","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/configure-extension.html","titles":[{"text":"Basic configuration","hash":"basic-configuration","id":1},{"text":"Configuration key transformation","hash":"configuration-key-transformation","id":2},{"text":"Configuration data","hash":"configuration-data","id":3}]},"107":{"id":107,"text":"An Antora extension is an exported JavaScript function named register. Antora invokes the function as soon as the generator starts (after the playbook is built). This function will typically add event listeners that listen for generator events. The event listeners hook into the lifecycle of the Antora generator to do the bulk of the work of the extension. To define an extension, start by creating a new JavaScript file (herein: extension file). We’ll name this extension my-extension.js. In the extension file, create a function and assign it to the register property of the module’s exports. We refer to this export as the register function. Exporting the function allows Antora to access it. Example 1. my-extension.js 'use strict' module.exports.register = () => { } You can split out the function definition from the export statement, if you prefer that style. Example 2. my-extension.js 'use strict' const register = () => { } module.exports = { register } Alternately, you can define your extension as a class-based extension. It’s good practice to start your extension file with the statement 'use strict'. This statement enables strict mode across all versions of Node.js. Strict mode activates a restricted variant of JavaScript that catches common programming errors. We’ll exclude it from the remaining examples in this area of the documentation, but assume it’s ever present. This example defines the register function using the arrow function syntax. You can also use the more formal function () {} syntax, which you’ll need to do in order to access the generator context. Put the script in your playbook repository. Later, you can publish it to a package repository such as npmjs.com to share it between different sites or branches. So far, our extension doesn’t actually do anything. Since the register function is a kind of listener, you can use it as an opportunity to perform an action immediately after the playbook is built. Let’s use it to say hi. Example 3. my-extension.js module.exports.register = () => { console.log('Hello from Antora!') } While that’s a fun trick, it’s not really what we’re after. What we want to do is tie deeper into the mechanics of the generator so we can do some real work, perhaps even modify the content that Antora is processing. For that, we need to grab the generator context. If the register function can be bound, meaning it’s defined using the function keyword or equivalent, Antora will bind the generator context to its this keyword. The this keyword is one way the extension can access the generator context. Example 4. my-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on(...) } Alternately, if the function accepts the generator context as the first parameter (using any name that begins with a letter), Antora will pass it as the first argument of the function instead of binding it to the this keyword. Example 5. my-extension.js without binding module.exports.register = (context) => { context.on(...) } The generator context is what you use to register event listeners. Before we get there, let’s look at the optional parameter for accessing context variables. The first positional parameter of the register function (or the second, if the function declares the generator context as the first parameter) is an object of context variables. This object includes the playbook and extension config. You should use object destructuring to pick individual variables out of this object. All event listeners can retrieve the playbook, but you might need it earlier when registering listeners. Here’s how you can access the playbook from the register function: Example 6. my-extension.js module.exports.register = function ({ playbook }) { console.log(`Antora is building the ${playbook.site.title}.`) } Now, let’s now register our extension, then add event listeners.","title":"Define an Extension","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"define-extension","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/define-extension.html","titles":[]},"108":{"id":108,"text":"By default, if you register an extension in the playbook file, Antora will enable it automatically. One way to enable an extension only on request is to specify it using the CLI option (--extension). However, that alone doesn’t allow you to provide configuration keys or influence the load order. That’s where extension enablement comes into play. You can register an extension in the playbook file, along with optional configuration, then tell Antora not to enable it. You can then use the CLI option (--extension) to enable it, and it will be registered relative to other extensions in the order listed in the playbook. To prevent Antora from enabling an extension specified in the playbook file, set the predefined configuration key enabled to the value false. When Antora sees that the enabled key has a value of false, it will not register the extension. Example 1. An extension that is not enabled antora: extensions: - require: ./my-extension.js enabled: false custom: value You can use the enabled key to quickly turn off an extension without having to remove it from the playbook. More likely, though, you mark it this way so that it can be enabled using the CLI option. However, in order to do that, you need a way to reference it. That’s the purpose of the predefined configuration key id. The id key specifies a value you can reference using the --extension CLI option to enable an extension that’s marked as not enabled in the playbook file. First, let’s give our extension an ID: Example 2. An extension with an ID that is not enabled antora: extensions: - id: my-extension require: ./my-extension.js enabled: false custom: value Now we can now enable this extension from the CLI as follows: $ antora --extension=my-extension antora-playbook.yml Whereas normally the value of the --extension CLI option is a require request, in the case when you are enabling an extension, the value is the ID of the extension entry in the playbook file. If Antora can’t locate an entry with an ID that matches the value of the --extension CLI option, it falls back to treating the value as a require request.","title":"Enable an Extension","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"enable-extension","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/enable-extension.html","titles":[]},"109":{"id":109,"text":"The generator context provides several utility methods that make writing extensions easier. These utility methods are called helpers because they help you to write extensions. The helpers are located on the generator context, which provides the GeneratorContext API. Thus, to use the helpers, you need a reference to the generator context. There are two ways to get the generator context. If the listener functions are defined within the register function for the extension, they can access the generator context from the register function by way of variable scoping. Otherwise, the listener function can reference the generator context using the standard this keyword. The generator context is bound to the listener function when the listener function is registered. One way to access context variables is to accept them via the first parameter of the register function or event listener function using object destructuring (e.g., { playbook }). However, there may be situations where a context variable is only needed conditionally. To simplify the function signature, you can retrieve context variables directly from the generator context using the getVariables helper. Here’s an example of how to access context variables from the generator context (bound to this) using the getVariables method: const { playbook, contentCatalog } = this.getVariables() Note that parameter destructuring is still the only way for the register function to access the config object for an extension. The updateVariables helper method provides a means for adding or replacing context variables. The method accepts a single argument of type Object, where the keys of the object are the variable names and the values are the variable values. This method doesn’t return a value. If you want to remove a variable, specify the value as undefined. Keep in mind that locked variables can’t be replaced. Here’s an example that shows how to replace the playbook and siteCatalog variables from a listener: playbook = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(playbook)) siteCatalog = new Proxy(siteCatalog, {}) this.updateVariables({ playbook, siteCatalog }) You can also use the updateVariables method to introduce new variables into the context. The site generator will not recognize or use these variables. However, other extensions, or listeners in the same extension, can use them. The stop helper method provides a way to stop the operation of the generator using an orderly shutdown. This method accepts an optional exit code value and doesn’t return a value. When called, this method causes the context to emit the contextStopped and contextClosed events. If any messages are logged that exceed the failure level threshold, Antora will exit with a non-zero exit code. Otherwise, Antora will exit with the specified exit code or, if no exit code is specified, a zero exit code (i.e., successfully). The stop helper is useful if you only need to run Antora partially and don’t want to throw an error to make Antora stop. You might use it for warming up a cache or performing reference validation. Keep in mind that if you call stop in any listener before the sitePublished event, Antora won’t publish the site. Here’s an example that shows how to signal to Antora in a listener to stop processing: console.log('Our work is done here. Wrap it up.') this.stop() The getLogger helper method allows you to retrieve an instance of the logger. Here’s an example that shows how to retrieve an instance of the logger and use it in a listener: module.exports.register = function () { const logger = this.getLogger('extension-name') this.on('playbookBuilt', () => { logger.info('Let it be known. The playbook has been built!') }) } You’ll see the following message in your terminal when you run Antora with this extension enabled (and the --log-level=info option): [12:24:37.731] INFO (extension-name): Let it be known. The playbook has been built! The require helper method allows you to require libraries within the context of the Antora installation. This method accepts a single argument of type String, which is a require request (i.e., the name of a Node.js module or a source file within a module). This method returns the object that the specified module or source file exports. If the request can’t be resolved, the method throws an Error with code MODULE_NOT_FOUND. From time to time when writing extensions, you may need to access code provided by Antora. Examples include the logger, the ContentCatalog, or a utility function like parseResourceId. This method allows you to require this code without having to declare a dependency on Antora. That dependency is implicit since the extension runs within the context of Antora. This method provides a way to require that code. Here’s an example that shows how to get the version of the site generator that is currently running from a listener: const { name, version } = this.require('@antora/site-generator/package') console.log(`Running ${name} version ${version}`) Since the extension is already running in the context of the site generator, here’s a slightly simpler way to achieve the same result: const { name, version } = this.require('../package') console.log(`Running ${name} version ${version}`) For a more practical example, you can use the require helper method to create a child logger for your extension. Typically, you’d do so in the register function, then access the same instance of the logger throughout your extension. module.exports.register = function () { const logger = this.require('@antora/logger')('extension-name') this.on('playbookBuilt', () => { logger.info('Let it be known. The playbook has been built!') }) } You’ll see the following message in your terminal when you run Antora with this extension enabled (and the --log-level=info option): [12:24:37.731] INFO (extension-name): Let it be known.

In this tutorial, we’ll create an extension that locates unlisted pages, which are pages not accessible from the navigation. The extension will first retrieve the navigation tree for each component version. It will then iterate through the pages in that component version and locate any pages that are not found in that navigation tree. If it finds any unlisted pages, it will log a warning for each. If configured to do so, it will also add those pages under a dedicated category in the navigation. This example gives you an opportunity to use much of the functionality available to extensions. We’ll create the extension, register it in the playbook, configure it, and finally run Antora with it enabled. Let’s get started. To begin, you first need to create the extension. Let’s name the extension file unlisted-pages-extension.js and place it in the lib/ folder adjacent to the playbook so it’s neatly organized in the playbook repository. Populate the extension file with the source code shown in Example 1. The next section will analyze what this code is doing. Example 1. lib/unlisted-pages-extension.js module.exports.register = function ({ config }) { const { addToNavigation, unlistedPagesHeading = 'Unlisted Pages' } = config const logger = this.getLogger('unlisted-pages-extension') this .on('navigationBuilt', ({ contentCatalog }) => { contentCatalog.getComponents().forEach(({ versions }) => { versions.forEach(({ name: component, version, navigation: nav, url: defaultUrl }) => { const navEntriesByUrl = getNavEntriesByUrl(nav) const unlistedPages = contentCatalog .findBy({ component, version, family: 'page' }) .filter((page) => page.out) .reduce((collector, page) => { if ((page.pub.url in navEntriesByUrl) || page.pub.url === defaultUrl) return collector logger.warn({ file: page.src, source: page.src.origin }, 'detected unlisted page') return collector.concat(page) }, []) if (unlistedPages.length && addToNavigation) { nav.push({ content: unlistedPagesHeading, items: unlistedPages.map((page) => { const title = 'navtitle' in page.asciidoc ? page.asciidoc.navtitle : (page.src.module === 'ROOT' ? '' : page.src.module + ':') + page.src.relative return { content: title, url: page.pub.url, urlType: 'internal' } }), root: true, }) } }) }) }) } function getNavEntriesByUrl (items = [], accum = {}) { items.forEach((item) => { if (item.urlType === 'internal') accum[item.url.split('#')[0]] = item getNavEntriesByUrl(item.items, accum) }) return accum } Let’s pause to break down what this extension does, step by step. The extension starts by exporting the register function, which Antora calls immediately after requiring the extension file. The register function is bound to the generator context, which it can use to add listeners. The function accepts the config object for the extension (via object destructuring) as the sole argument. It goes on to pull several configuration keys out of the config object to customize its behavior. module.exports.register = function ({ config }) { const { addToNavigation, unlistedPagesHeading = 'Unlisted Pages' } = config } Next, the extension creates a named logger that it can use for reporting unlisted pages. It does so by calling getLogger on the context to create a named logger. This method, in turn, requires the @antora/logger module provided by Antora, then passes the name to its default function to create the child logger. const logger = this.getLogger('unlisted-pages-extension') The extension then adds a listener for the navigationBuilt event. Since the extension needs access to the navigation, this is the right opportunity in the generator to examine the navigation trees. To access the navigation and the pages, the listener retrieves the contentCatalog object from the context variables using object destructuring. The navigationBuilt event is emitted after the pages have been converted, which provides access to the navtitle for each page. this .on('navigationBuilt', ({ contentCatalog }) => { }) When called, the listener for the navigationBuilt event retrieves the navigation tree for each component version from the content catalog, as well as some information about the component version for locating its pages. contentCatalog.getComponents().forEach(({ versions }) => { versions.forEach(({ name: component, version, navigation: nav, url: defaultUrl }) => { }) }) To make it easier to find pages in the navigation, the extension provides a helper to create a lookup table for each entry in the navigation by URL, ignoring any duplicates. function getNavEntriesByUrl (items = [], accum = {}) { items.forEach((item) => { if (item.urlType === 'internal') accum[item.url.split('#')[0]] = item getNavEntriesByUrl(item.items, accum) }) return accum } The extension then uses this helper to create that lookup table for each navigation: const navEntriesByUrl = getNavEntriesByUrl(nav) Now the real work begins. The extension returns to the content catalog to find all pages in the current component version, filtering that list to find only the publishable pages (i.e., pages which have an out property). It then checks to see if the page is found in the navigation by comparing resource URLs. If it can’t find a match, it logs a warning using the logger and adds the page to the collector being returned. const unlistedPages = contentCatalog .findBy({ component, version, family: 'page' }) .filter((page) => page.out) .reduce((collector, page) => { if ((page.pub.url in navEntriesByUrl) || page.pub.url === defaultUrl) return collector logger.warn({ file: page.src, source: page.src.origin }, 'detected unlisted page') return collector.concat(page) }, []) Let’s have a closer look at that warning message. logger.warn({ file: page.src, source: page.src.origin }, 'detected unlisted page') Notice that we’re passing an object as the first argument and the message as the second. The keys of the object passed as the first argument get merged into the structured log message. Antora’s logger provides a custom formatter for the file and source keys when outputting a pretty log message. The file key should point to an object with a path key and, if applicable, an abspath key. The simplest way to provide this content is to pass the src property of the virtual file, which has all the necessary information about where the file is located. The origin key should point to the src.origin property on the virtual file, which provides information about the content source. You can also pass in an optional line number using the line key. The custom formatter will compile all this information into a formatted message to help the user locate the relevant file. Finally, if the extension finds unlisted pages, it adds them to a new category in the navigation with the special heading if configured to do so. if (unlistedPages.length && addToNavigation) { nav.push({ content: unlistedPagesHeading, items: unlistedPages.map((page) => { const title = 'navtitle' in page.asciidoc ? page.asciidoc.navtitle : (page.src.module === 'ROOT' ? '' : page.src.module + ':') + page.src.relative return { content: title, url: page.pub.url, urlType: 'internal' } }), root: true, }) } The addToNavigation variable comes from the configuration key add_to_navigation on the extension entry. Antora automatically converts configuration key names to camelCase to make them consistent with variable naming conventions in JavaScript. Remove unlisted pages Instead of adding unlisted pages to the navigation, you could instead remove them from the site. This would be one way of limiting which pages get published. unlistedPages.forEach((page) => contentCatalog.removeFile(page)) If you go this route, you’ll probably want to remove the warning for unlisted pages, or downgrade it to the info or debug severity level. Now that the extension is written, and you understand what it does, it’s time to register it. To register the extension, you add a require request entry for it in the antora.extensions key in the playbook. In our case, the require request is the relative path from the playbook file to the extension file. antora: extensions: - ./lib/unlisted-pages-extension.js The extension will be called the next time you run Antora. However, since this extension is configurable, we’ll want to use the more formal entry format to make room for those configuration keys. To register an extension with configuration, you add a map entry for it in the antora.extensions key in the playbook. In doing so, you’ll define the require request in the require key, making way for the other configuration keys. antora: extensions: - require: ./lib/unlisted-pages-extension.js add_to_navigation: true unlisted_pages_heading: Orphans If you want the extension to only be used when specified using the --extension CLI option, you’ll need to set the id and enabled keys as well. antora: extensions: - id: unlisted-pages enabled: false require: ./lib/unlisted-pages-extension.js add_to_navigation: true unlisted_pages_heading: Orphans Now the extension will only run if you pass --extension=unlisted-pages to Antora when you run it. When an extension accepts configuration, it’s always wise to register it in the playbook, even if you don’t want it to be enabled by default. All that’s left is to use the extension when you run Antora. If the extension is enabled (as it is by default), all you need to do is run Antora and pass the playbook file, as you normally would: $ antora antora-playbook If the extension is not enabled, you need to enable it when you run Antora using the --extension CLI option: $ antora --extension=unlisted-pages antora-playbook.yml If you have unlisted pages in your playbook, you’ll see a warning message similar to this one: [12:02:02.532] WARN (unlisted-pages-extension): detected unlisted page source: /path/to/worktree (refname: main , start path: docs) file: modules/ROOT/pages/name-of-page.adoc If the add_to_navigation key is true, you’ll also find the page listed in the unlisted pages category at the bottom of the navigation tree. To fix the problem of an unlisted page, find the appropriate nav file and add an entry for the unlisted page, then run Antora again to check your work. Congratulations! You’ve made your first Antora extension.","title":"Extension Tutorial","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"extension-tutorial","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/extension-tutorial.html","titles":[{"text":"Create the extension","hash":"create-the-extension","id":1},{"text":"How the extension works","hash":"how-the-extension-works","id":2},{"text":"Register the extension","hash":"register-the-extension","id":3},{"text":"Configure the extension","hash":"configure-the-extension","id":4},{"text":"Use the extension","hash":"use-the-extension","id":5}]},"111":{"id":111,"text":"This page provides a catalog of simple examples to showcase how you can enhance the capabilities of Antora through the use of extensions. Each section introduces a different use case and presents the extension code you can build on as a starting point. You can also reference official extension projects provided by the Antora project to study more complex examples. If you want to define global AsciiDoc attributes that dynamic values, you can do using an extension. The playbook holds the AsciiDoc config object, which itself contains the global AsciiDoc attributes. An extension can listen for the playbookBuilt event and add attributes to this map. Example 1. set-global-asciidoc-attributes-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on('beforeProcess', ({ siteAsciiDocConfig }) => { const buildDate = new Date().toISOString() siteAsciiDocConfig.attributes['build-date'] = buildDate }) } The extension could read these values from a file or environment variables as well. If you need to set AsciiDoc attributes that are scoped to a component version, then you’ll need to listen for the contentClassified event instead. From there, you can access the AsciiDoc attributes form the asciidoc property on a component version object. You can look up a component version by name and version using the getComponentVersion method on the content catalog object. Alternately, you can access component versions from the versions property on each component returned by the getComponents method on the content catalog object. If you’re troubleshooting your site, you can use an extension to generate a report of AsciiDoc attributes at the site level and those per component verison. When making this report, you have a choice of whether you want to show the AsciiDoc attributes as they would be available to a page (aka compiled) or as defined (aka uncompiled) You can use the following extension to print all the AsciiDoc attributes compiled for each component version. The extension also prints all the attributes compiled from the playbook, though keep in mind these are integrated into the attributes for each component version. Example 2. print-compiled-asciidoc-attributes-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.once('contentClassified', ({ siteAsciiDocConfig, contentCatalog }) => { console.log('site-wide attributes (compiled)') console.log(siteAsciiDocConfig.attributes) contentCatalog.getComponents().forEach((component) => { component.versions.forEach((componentVersion) => { console.log(`${componentVersion.version}@${componentVersion.name} attributes (compiled)`) if (componentVersion.asciidoc === siteAsciiDocConfig) { console.log('same as site-wide attributes') } else { console.log(componentVersion.asciidoc.attributes) } }) }) }) } You can use the following extension to print all the AsciiDoc attributes as defined in the playbook and in the antora.yml file for each component version (by origin). Example 3. print-defined-asciidoc-attributes-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.once('contentClassified', ({ playbook, contentCatalog }) => { console.log('site-wide attributes (as defined in playbook)') console.log(playbook.asciidoc.attributes) contentCatalog.getComponents().forEach((component) => { component.versions.forEach((componentVersion) => { getUniqueOrigins(contentCatalog, componentVersion).forEach((origin) => { console.log(`${componentVersion.version}@${componentVersion.name} attributes (as defined in antora.yml)`) console.log(origin.descriptor.asciidoc?.attributes || {}) }) }) }) }) } function getUniqueOrigins (contentCatalog, componentVersion) { return contentCatalog.findBy({ component: componentVersion.name, version: componentVersion.version }) .reduce((origins, file) => { const origin = file.src.origin if (origin && !origins.includes(origin)) origins.push(origin) return origins }, []) } You may find it useful to make use of these collections of AsciiDoc attributes when writing other extensions. If some contributors or CI jobs don’t have permission to the private content sources in the playbook, you can use an extension to filter them out instead of having to modify the playbook file. This extension runs during the playbookBuilt event. It retrieves the playbook, iterates over the content sources, and removes any content source that it detects as private and thus require authentication. We’ll rely on a convention to communicate to the extension which content source is private. That convention is to use an SSH URL that starts with git@. Antora automatically converts SSH URLs to HTTP URLs, so the use of this syntax merely serves as a hint to users and extensions that the URL is private and is going to request authentication. Example 4. exclude-private-content-sources-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on('playbookBuilt', function ({ playbook }) { playbook.content.sources = playbook.content.sources .filter(({ url }) => !url.startsWith('git@')) this.updateVariables({ playbook }) }) } This extension works because the playbook is mutable until the end of this event, at which point Antora freezes it. The call to this.updateVariables to replace the playbook variable in the generator context is not required, but is used here to express intent and to future proof the extension. If you don’t want a page to ever be published, you can prefix the filename with an underscore (e.g., _hidden.adoc). However, if you only want the page to be unpublished conditionally, then you need to reach for an extension. When using this extension, any page that sets the page-unpublish page attribute will not be published (meaning it will be unpublished). For example: = Secret Page :page-unpublish: This page will not be published. You can set the page-unpublish page attribute based on the presence (or absence) of another AsciiDoc attribute, perhaps one set in the playbook or as a CLI option. For example: = Secret Page ifndef::include-secret[:page-unpublish:] This page will not be published. This extension runs during the documentsConverted event. This is the earliest event that provides access to the AsciiDoc metadata on the virtual file. The extension iterates over all publishable pages in the content catalog and unpublishes any page that sets the page-unpublish attribute. To unpublish the page, the extension removes the out property on the virtual file. If the out property is absent, the page will not be published. Example 5. page-unpublish-tag-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on('documentsConverted', ({ contentCatalog }) => { contentCatalog.getPages((page) => page.out).forEach((page) => { if (page.asciidoc?.attributes['page-unpublish'] != null) { delete page.out } }) }) } Keep in mind that there may be references to the unpublished page. While they will be resolved by Antora, the target of the reference will not be available, which will result in a 404 response from the web server. For more fine-grained control over when a page is unpublished, you could write an extension that replaces the convertDocument or convertDocuments functions. Doing so would allow you to unpublish the page before references to it from other pages are resolved so that they appear as warnings. After you create a new page, it’s easy to forget to add it to the navigation so that the reader can access it. We can use an extension to identify pages which are not in the navigation and report them using the logger. This extension runs during the navigationBuilt event. It iterates over each component version, retrieves a flattened list of its internal navigation entries, then checks to see if there are any pages that are not in that list, comparing pages by URL. If it finds any such pages, it creates a report of them, optionally adding them to the navigation. Example 6. unlisted-pages-extension.js module.exports.register = function ({ config }) { const { addToNavigation, unlistedPagesHeading = 'Unlisted Pages' } = config const logger = this.getLogger('unlisted-pages-extension') this .on('navigationBuilt', ({ contentCatalog }) => { contentCatalog.getComponents().forEach(({ versions }) => { versions.forEach(({ name: component, version, navigation: nav, url: defaultUrl }) => { const navEntriesByUrl = getNavEntriesByUrl(nav) const unlistedPages = contentCatalog .findBy({ component, version, family: 'page' }) .filter((page) => page.out) .reduce((collector, page) => { if ((page.pub.url in navEntriesByUrl) || page.pub.url === defaultUrl) return collector logger.warn({ file: page.src, source: page.src.origin }, 'detected unlisted page') return collector.concat(page) }, []) if (unlistedPages.length && addToNavigation) { nav.push({ content: unlistedPagesHeading, items: unlistedPages.map((page) => { const title = 'navtitle' in page.asciidoc ? page.asciidoc.navtitle : (page.src.module === 'ROOT' ?

Instead of reporting unlisted pages, you could instead remove those pages from publishing. This is one way you can use the navigation to drive which pages are published. This extension runs during the navigationBuilt event. It iterates over each component version, retrieves a flattened list of its internal navigation entries, then checks to see if there are any pages that are not in that list, comparing pages by URL. If it finds any such pages, it unpublishes them. Example 7. unpublish-unlisted-pages-extension.js module.exports.register = function ({ config }) { this .on('navigationBuilt', ({ contentCatalog }) => { contentCatalog.getComponents().forEach(({ versions }) => { versions.forEach(({ name: component, version, navigation: nav, url: defaultUrl }) => { const navEntriesByUrl = getNavEntriesByUrl(nav) const unlistedPages = contentCatalog .findBy({ component, version, family: 'page' }) .filter((page) => page.out) .reduce((collector, page) => { if ((page.pub.url in navEntriesByUrl) || page.pub.url === defaultUrl) return collector return collector.concat(page) }, []) if (unlistedPages.length) unlistedPages.forEach((page) => delete page.out) }) }) }) } function getNavEntriesByUrl (items = [], accum = {}) { items.forEach((item) => { if (item.urlType === 'internal') accum[item.url.split('#')[0]] = item getNavEntriesByUrl(item.items, accum) }) return accum } By removing the out property from the page, it prevents the page from being published, but is still referenceable using an include directive. Alternately, you could choose to remove the page entirely from the content catalog. When you’re setting up your playbook, you may find that Antora is not discovering some of your component versions. Using an extension, it’s possible to list the component versions Antora discovers during content aggregation along with the content sources it took them from. Example 8. discovered-component-versions-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.once('contentAggregated', ({ contentAggregate }) => { console.log('Discovered the following component versions') contentAggregate.forEach((bucket) => { const sources = bucket.origins.map(({ url, refname }) => ({ url, refname })) console.log({ name: bucket.name, version: bucket.version, files: bucket.files.length, sources }) }) }) } If an entry is missing, then you know you may need to tune the content source definitions in your playbook. For more information, you can print the whole bucket entry. Files in the attachment family are passed directly through to the output site. Antora does not resolve AsciiDoc attribute references in attachment files. (Asciidoctor, on the other hand, will resolve AsciiDoc attribute references in the attachment’s contents only if the attachment is included in an AsciiDoc page where the attribute substitution is enabled.) You can use an Antora extension to have Antora resolve attribute references in the attachment file before that file is published. This extension runs during the contentClassified event, which is when attachment files are first identified and classified. It iterates over all attachments and resolves any references to attributes scoped to that attachment’s component version. If any changes were made to the contents of the file, it replaces the contents on the virtual file with the updated value. Example 9. resolve-attributes-references-in-attachments-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on('contentClassified', ({ contentCatalog }) => { const componentVersionTable = contentCatalog.getComponents().reduce((componentMap, component) => { componentMap[component.name] = component.versions.reduce((versionMap, componentVersion) => { versionMap[componentVersion.version] = componentVersion return versionMap }, {}) return componentMap }, {}) contentCatalog.findBy({ family: 'attachment' }).forEach((attachment) => { const componentVersion = componentVersionTable[attachment.src.component][attachment.src.version] let attributes = componentVersion.asciidoc?.attributes if (!attributes) return attributes = Object.entries(attributes).reduce((accum, [name, val]) => { accum[name] = val && val.endsWith('@') ? val.slice(0, val.length - 1) : val return accum }, {}) let modified const result = attachment.contents.toString().replace(/\\{([\\p{Alpha}\\d_][\\p{Alpha}\\d_-]*)\\}/gu, (match, name) => { if (!(name in attributes)) return match modified = true let value = attributes[name] if (value.endsWith('@')) value = value.slice(0, value.length - 1) return value }) if (modified) attachment.contents = Buffer.from(result) }) }) } This extension is only know to work with text-based attachments. You may need to modify this extension for it to work with binary files. Much like AsciiDoc files (.adoc) are converted to HTML (.html) by Antora, you can do the same with attachments. This extension runs during the contentClassified event, which is when attachment files are first identified and classified. It iterates over all attachments in a word processor format (i.e., .docx, .odt, .fodt) and uses the libreoffcie command (LibreOffice in server mode) to convert each file to PDF. Example 10. doc-to-pdf-extension.js const fsp = require('node:fs/promises') const ospath = require('node:path') const { posix: path } = ospath const { execFile } = require('node:child_process') module.exports.register = function () { this.once('contentClassified', async ({ playbook, contentCatalog }) => { const docExtnames = { '.docx': true, '.fodt': true, '.odt': true } const filesToConvert = contentCatalog.getFiles().filter(({ src }) => src.family === 'attachment' && docExtnames[src.extname]) if (!filesToConvert.length) return const buildDirBase = ospath.join(playbook.dir, 'build/doc-to-pdf') const convertArgs = ['--writer', '--convert-to', 'pdf'] const convertOpts = { cwd: buildDirBase, windowsHide: true } try { await fsp.mkdir(buildDirBase, { recursive: true }) await Promise.all(filesToConvert.map((file) => { const sourceRelpath = `${file.src.component}-${file.src.module}-${file.out.basename}` convertArgs.push(sourceRelpath) return fsp.writeFile(ospath.join(buildDirBase, sourceRelpath), file.contents) })) await new Promise((resolve, reject) => { execFile('libreoffice', convertArgs, convertOpts, (err, stderr, stdout) => { if (!err) return resolve() const splitIdx = stderr.indexOf('Usage: ') if (~splitIdx) stderr = stderr.slice(0, splitIdx).trimEnd() if (stderr) err.message += stderr reject(err) }) }) await Promise.all(filesToConvert.map((file) => { file.out.path = path.join(file.out.dirname, (file.out.basename = file.out.basename.slice(0, -file.src.extname.length) + '.pdf')) file.pub.url = file.pub.url.slice(0, -file.src.extname.length) + '.pdf' const sourceRelpath = `${file.src.component}-${file.src.module}-${file.out.basename}` return fsp.readFile(ospath.join(buildDirBase, sourceRelpath)).then((contents) => (file.contents = contents)) })) } finally { await fsp.rm(buildDirBase, { recursive: true, force: true }) } }) } By converting the files and updating the metadata, it’s possible to reference the source document using the xref macro. That reference will automatically translate to a link to the PDF in the generated site. If you are integrating with a search or AI engine, you may want to extract the plain text of the pages to a file along with the page url, title, and navigation path. You can use the following extension to do that as part of the site build. Example 11. export-content-extension.js const { parse: parseHTML } = require('node-html-parser') /** * An Antora extension that exports the content of publishable pages in plain text to a JSON * file along with the page URL and title. */ module.exports.register = function () { this.once('navigationBuilt', ({ playbook, contentCatalog, siteCatalog }) => { const siteUrl = playbook.site.url const component = 'dfcs' const version = '' const componentVersion = contentCatalog.getComponentVersion(component, version) const dfcsNavEntriesByUrl = getNavEntriesByUrl(componentVersion.navigation) const pages = contentCatalog .getPages((it) => it.src.component === component && it.src.version === version && it.pub) .map((page) => { const siteRelativeUrl = page.pub.url const articleDom = parseHTML(`${page.contents}`) // TODO might want to apply the sentence newline replacement per paragraph const text = articleDom.textContent.trim().replace(/\\n(\\s*\\n)+/g, '\\n\\n').replace(/\\.\\n(?!\\n)/g, '. ') const path = [componentVersion.title] path.push(...(dfcsNavEntriesByUrl[siteRelativeUrl]?.path?.map((it) => it.content) || [])) return { url: siteUrl + siteRelativeUrl, title: page.title, text, path } }) siteCatalog.addFile({ contents: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ pages }, null, ' ')), out: { path: 'site-content.json' }, }) }) } function getNavEntriesByUrl (items = [], accum = {}, path = []) { items.forEach((item) => { if (item.urlType === 'internal') accum[item.url.split('#')[0]] = { item, path: path.concat(item) } getNavEntriesByUrl(item.items, accum, item.content ? path.concat(item) : path) }) return accum } Note that this extension relies on the node-html-parser package. You will need to include that in your site package.json file in order to use this extension. In the future, Antora may provide a built-in HTML parser for extensions to use.","title":"Extension Use Cases","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"extension-use-cases","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/extension-use-cases.html","titles":[{"text":"Set global AsciiDoc attributes","hash":"set-global-asciidoc-attributes","id":1},{"text":"Print AsciiDoc attributes","hash":"print-asciidoc-attributes","id":2},{"text":"Exclude private content sources","hash":"exclude-private-content-sources","id":3},{"text":"Unpublish flagged pages","hash":"unpublish-flagged-pages","id":4},{"text":"Report unlisted pages","hash":"report-unlisted-pages","id":5},{"text":"Unpublish unlisted pages","hash":"unpublish-unlisted-pages","id":6},{"text":"List discovered component versions","hash":"list-discovered-component-versions","id":7},{"text":"Resolve attribute references in attachments","hash":"resolve-attribute-references-in-attachments","id":8},{"text":"Convert word processor attachments to PDF","hash":"convert-word-processor-attachments-to-pdf","id":9},{"text":"Export content to file","hash":"export-content-to-file","id":10}]},"112":{"id":112,"text":"Antora provides an event-based extension facility you can tap into to augment or influence the functionality of the generator. This extension facility is designed for users of all experience levels. This page provides a high-level summary of how the extension facility works and introduces you to the concepts and terminology you need to know to create or use extensions. Subsequent pages step you through creating your first extension. As described in How Antora Works, Antora’s site generator is a sequence of discrete, functional steps that progressively work to generate a static site. This pipeline of steps begins with reading the playbook and gathering the source material. It ends with publishing the HTML files and web assets to the output destination. Antora’s extension facility, which is implemented by Antora’s site generator, provides a way to hook custom code into the generator’s build process. Antora’s extension facility is event-driven, meaning it works by emitting events. Events are emitted (aka fired) to notify extension code (i.e., event listeners) of interesting transitions that occur during site generation (i.e., the execution of Antora). Specifically, once each discrete step in the generator is complete, and at other key transition points, Antora emits a named event (e.g., contentAggregated). Events are handled by functions called listeners, which must be registered with that event. To hook your code into the operation of Antora, you register extensions that listen to one or more of these events. These listeners are defined in the register function of the extension. The listeners of an event can be synchronous or asynchronous, but are called synchronously and in sequence. Any value returned by an event listener is ignored. Once all the listeners for an event have finished running, the generator proceeds to the next step. In brief, Antora extensions register listeners that respond to transition events emitted by the site generator. Subsequent pages go into detail about how to set up listeners, which events those listeners can observe, and how to access context variables. The extension facility in Antora is loosely based on the EventEmitter in Node.js. Antora uses an abstraction over this eventing system called the GeneratorContext, which adapts the EventEmitter for this use case. When the generator starts, it creates an instance of the GeneratorContext, called the generator context. This object is then bound to each extension and its event listeners. The generator context is responsible for keeping track of event listeners, storing the generator functions, managing context variables as they flow through the generator, notifying listeners of an event, and providing helpers to make writing extensions easier. It’s, quite literally, the context of the generator’s execution. Most of the time, you’ll interact with the on method provided by the generator context to bind your event listener to an event. You can also use the generator context to provide custom generator functions. An event listener is a callback function that’s invoked (i.e., notified) when an event is emitted. This callback mechanism provides a way to insert code between any two discrete steps of the generator. Antora will wait for the listener to run to completion, even if it’s async, before proceeding. A listener can modify the state of in-scope variables in the generator, add new variables, or replace existing variables. More times than not, a listener will add additional files to one or more of the catalogs for processing or publishing. Listeners of the same event are invoked in sequence to prevent them from interfering with one another. Generator functions are the predefined, discrete steps the generator performs. Although most extensions will listen for generator events, an extension can also replace one or more of these generator functions. This capability is used when you want to alter the built-in behavior in Antora, such as how the navigation is built. As with event listeners, generator functions are configured on the generator context. To hook your own generator functions into the operation of Antora, you register an extension that assigns those functions to the generator context. An extension wouldn’t be much use if it couldn’t access any of the configuration, content, or other data being processed by the generator. That’s where context variables come in. The context variables provide access to the in-scope objects flowing through the generator. These variables are stored on the generator context, hence the name context variables. A listener can pick any of those variables out of the generator context and work with them. In fact, a listener can read the same variables that the generator itself can read. The listener can also push new or replacement variables into the context, as long as those variables are not locked. To give you an idea of the kinds of extensions you can write and what’s possible, here’s a glimpse at the things an extension can do to affect the operation of the generator: Modify the configuration (i.e., playbook) Change the state of a context variable, such as adding a new file to a catalog Push a new variable into the context Replace or proxy context variables Replace or proxy generator functions Introduce new steps (in a listener or custom generator function) Raise custom events Log messages Require user code Postprocess content, such as replacing strings in HTML files Publish new files Unpublish files Stop processing In general, an extension taps into the generator and tunes its behavior rather than doing a wholesale replacement of it. There are some limitations with this approach, but it’s a trade-off for providing something that’s broadly accessible. An extension can’t change the order of steps (i.e., generator functions) that the generator performs. It also can’t make the generator skip steps. However, it can replace an existing step with an empty or custom function. The most drastic thing an extension can do is to stop the processing early. This action is useful if the work of an extension is complete and no additional processing is necessary. For example, an extension may only need to report on the content in the site, in which case it can stop the generator before the publishing step.","title":"Antora Extensions","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"extensions","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/extensions.html","titles":[{"text":"Generator events","hash":"generator-events","id":1},{"text":"The generator context","hash":"the-generator-context","id":2},{"text":"What’s an event listener?","hash":"whats-an-event-listener","id":3},{"text":"What’s a generator function?","hash":"whats-a-generator-function","id":4},{"text":"What are context variables?","hash":"what-are-context-variables","id":5},{"text":"What can an extension do?","hash":"what-can-an-extension-do","id":6},{"text":"What can’t an extension do?","hash":"what-cant-an-extension-do","id":7}]},"113":{"id":113,"text":"The GeneratorContext API is the main point of access into Antora’s extension facility. Antora creates an instance of the GeneratorContext, called the generator context, and binds it to the register function of an extension as well as any listeners it adds. This object is shared across all extensions and event listeners. The generator context provides a way to add those event listeners. It also provides a handful of context-aware helpers that make writing extensions easier. The GeneratorContext class extends the Node.js EventEmitter type. All methods on the EventEmitter are inherited by and available on the generator context. However, you should never call the emit object to emit one of Antora’s own events. In addition to the methods on EventEmitter, the following table describes the methods provided by the GeneratorContext API. Table 1. Additional methods provided by the GeneratorContext Method name Parameter(s) Description getFunctions none Returns the object of generator functions. A generator function is defined as any of the discrete steps in the generator, as well as key utility functions those steps use. The built-in generator functions are not available until the contextStarted event is emitted. This object is read only. getLogger String Creates an instance of the specified named logger. If an argument is specified, and the value is not falsy, the method returns a child logger with the specified name. If an argument is specified, and the value is empty, the method returns the root logger. If an argument is specified, and the value is null, the method returns the root logger or undefined if the logger hasn’t been configured. If no argument is specified, the method returns a logger with the name antora. The logger is always created, if needed, unless the argument value is null. getVariables none Returns the object of context variables. This object is read only. lockVariable String Locks the specified context variable and returns its value. replaceFunctions Object Binds the specified functions to the generator context and uses them to replace existing functions on the generator context. If this method is called before the contextStarted event, the corresponding built-in generator functions will not be required and registered. removeVariable String Removes the specified context variable if the variable is not locked and returns its value. An error is thrown if the variable is locked. require String Requires the name of a module in the context of the Antora generator. This method can be used to require Antora internals without having to declare the Antora component as a dependency. stop none Stops the operation of the generator (using an orderly shut down by emitting the contextStopped and contextClosed events) and exits using the specified exit code. If an exit code is not specified, the process will use the exit code set on the process, or 0 if no exit code is set. updateVariables Object Adds or replaces the context variables with the specified variables.

There are two ways to register an extension. You can specify it using the --extension CLI option or you can list it as an entry in the extensions key under the antora category key in the playbook file. Once registered, Antora invokes the register function of the extension in the order it’s listed in the playbook file or passed to the CLI. The extensions in the playbook file are registered before the extensions passed to the CLI, though this order can be changed by enabling a registered extension on request. A quick way to register (and enable) an extension without modifying the playbook file is to specify it using the --extension option provided by the antora CLI. The --extension CLI option adds entries to the extensions key in the Antora playbook at runtime. Here’s an example of how to use this CLI option to register our extension. --extension ./my-extension.js If you have more than one extension to register, you can specify this option multiple times. Using the CLI option requires you to type a longer command each time you run Antora. For that reason, it’s often better to specify it in the playbook file, particularly if you’re going to always use it. Later on you’ll learn that even if you do add it to the playbook file, it’s still possible to control when it’s activated using the CLI. An Antora extension can be registered in the playbook file using the extensions key. The extensions key is specified under the antora category key. The value of the extensions key must be an array. Each entry in the array is either a string or a map (key/value pairs). When the value is a string, the value is assumed to be a require request (i.e., path or module name) that resolves to the extension script. When the value is a map, the require request must be specified using the require key. Using a map leaves room for additional configuration keys, both predefined (like enabled) and custom. If you were to publish the extension to a package repository, then the require request would be the name of that package (i.e., its module name). In that case, ensure that the package is configured as a dependency of the playbook project so that Node.js fetches it. Antora doesn’t download npm packages for you. Let’s register our extension in the playbook file so we can see it in action. In its simplest form, the extension entry is the require request (i.e., path) to the extension script. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml with extension antora: extensions: - ./my-extension.js We prefix the path with ./ to indicate that its location is relative to the playbook file. See the @antora/user-require-helper usage to learn how Antora resolves require requests in the playbook file. When you run Antora, you should now see a line like this in your terminal: Antora is building the Example Docs. If you need to specify configuration settings for the extension, then you must change the entry type from a string to a map. When making this change, the require request must now be specified on the require key. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml with extension specified using require key antora: extensions: - require: ./my-extension.js optional_behavior: true By using a map, additional keys can be added as siblings of the require key in order to pass configuration to the extension. You can find an example of how to use these additional keys to configure an extension on the Configure an Extension page. Our next step is to add event listeners to our extension.","title":"Register an Extension","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"register-extension","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/register-extension.html","titles":[{"text":"CLI option","hash":"extension-option","id":1},{"text":"Playbook key","hash":"extensions-key","id":2},{"text":"Without configuration","hash":"without-configuration","id":3},{"text":"With configuration","hash":"with-configuration","id":4}]},"116":{"id":116,"text":"Antora’s site generator is implemented as a sequence of steps. Each step is performed by a function. These functions are known as generator functions. Generator functions may contain functions for key substeps a generator function may perform, such as convertDocument. The generator retrieves these functions from the generator context. These functions can also be retrieved and replaced programmatically by an Antora extension. As such, these generator functions are designed to be replaceable, providing a more powerful way to extend Antora. Replacing functions in an extension does put the code at greater risk of breaking between major versions of Antora. Like with context variables, generator functions are available from the generator context. The generator functions can be retrieved by calling the getFunctions method inside the listener of the contextStarted event, or at any point thereafter. This method returns an object of key-value pairs, where the keys are the function names and the values are the function objects. The built-in generator functions are not available until the contextStarted event is emitted. Here’s an example that shows how to retrieve the aggregateContent function in an extension, assuming this is bound to the generator content. this.once('contextStarted', () => { const { aggregateContent } = this.getFunctions() }) One reason to retrieve a generator function is to use it as a utility. For example, if you need your extension to load AsciiDoc as Antora does, you might retrieve the loadAsciiDoc function for this purpose. Here’s an example: this.once('contentClassified', (contentCatalog, siteAsciiDocConfig) => { const { loadAsciiDoc } = this.getFunctions() const page = contentCatalog.resolvePage('ROOT::index.adoc') const scopedAsciiDocConfig = contentCatalog.getComponentVersion(page.src.component, page.src.version).asciidoc const doc = loadAsciiDoc(page, contentCatalog, scopedAsciiDocConfig || siteAsciiDocConfig) const sections = doc.findBy({ context: 'section' }, (it) => it !== doc.getHeader()) console.log(sections.map((it) => it.getTitle())) }) Another reason to retrieve a generator function is to decorate (aka wrap) it. In this case, you’ll need to replace the original function with the decorated one. Alternately, you can replace the original function with your own implementation. Replacing generator functions gives you the ability to override steps in Antora’s site generator. The generator functions can be replaced by passing functions to the replaceFunctions method. This method accepts the same object signature that the getFunctions method returns, where the keys are the function names and the values are the function objects. You only have to pass functions to replaceFunctions that you want to replace. The generator will default to using the built-in functions for any function that’s not replaced. Here’s an example that shows how to replace the publishFiles function in an extension: module.exports.register = function () { this.replaceFunctions({ async publishFiles () { console.log('Not publishing today') return [] } }) } When the functions are replaced matters. If you replace a function directly in the register method (before the contextStarted event is emitted), it will stop Antora from requiring and registering the corresponding built-in function. If you replace a function in the contextStarted listener, the function will replace the corresponding built-in function that has already been required and registered. The contextStarted event gives you the opportunity to delegate to (i.e., wrap) a built-in function, as shown here: module.exports.register = function () { this.once('contextStarted', () => { const { publishFiles: publishFilesDelegate } = this.getFunctions() this.replaceFunctions({ async publishFiles (playbook, catalogs) { console.log('It\\'s publish time!') return publishFilesDelegate.call(this, playbook, catalogs) } }) }) } When replacing a function, you must adhere to the function’s signature as defined in Function reference. Like with the register function and event listener functions, the generator functions are automatically bound to the generator context. The list of functions that can be replaced by an extension, shown along with their signatures, are as follows: aggregateContent(playbook): Promise buildNavigation(contentCatalog, siteAsciiDocConfig): NavigationCatalog classifyContent(playbook, contentAggregate, siteAsciiDocConfig): ContentCatalog convertDocument(file, contentCatalog, siteAsciiDocConfig): File convertDocuments(contentCatalog, siteAsciiDocConfig): void createPageComposer(playbook, contentCatalog, uiCatalog, env): Function extractAsciiDocMetadata(doc): Object loadAsciiDoc(file, contentCatalog, config): Document loadUi(uiCatalog): Promise mapSite(playbook, publishablePages): File[] produceRedirects(playbook, contentCatalog): File[] publishFiles(playbook, catalogs): Promise resolveAsciiDocConfig(playbook): Object To learn more about these functions, consult the Antora source code.","title":"Replace Generator Functions","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"replace-generator-functions","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/replace-generator-functions.html","titles":[{"text":"Get the functions","hash":"get-the-functions","id":1},{"text":"Replace a function","hash":"replace-a-function","id":2},{"text":"Function reference","hash":"function-reference","id":3}]},"117":{"id":117,"text":"On this page, you’ll find the list of Antora components that can be assembled into a custom site generator pipeline. Antora has a modular architecture so that components can be easily removed and replaced. Due to its API, you can also integrate Asciidoctor extensions. Core components are assembled into a pipeline by the Site Generator Default component. The Core components are versioned together. At this time, only Core components with the same version are designed to work together. For example, if you want to use the Content Classifier and Page Composer in a custom site generator, make sure each component has the same version. If you use the CLI (@antora/cli) with the site generator (@antora/site-generator), then you just have to keep the versions of the CLI and the site generator in sync. If you make a custom site generator, you are responsible for keeping each individual component you use in sync. Extended components provide key functionality for special use cases. An example of an Extended component is a file publisher provider for an Amazon S3 bucket. Once ready for general availability, Extended components are released and versioned individually.

The fun with extensions really starts once you start to access these context variables. A context variable is a variable that is in scope at the time an event is emitted and that the generator binds to the generator context. By accessing a context variable from an extension, you can: read properties from the object, call methods on the object, or modify properties on the object (provided the object is not frozen). In Update context variables, you’ll learn how to replace the variable with a proxy of the object, which is another option. The first positional parameter of each event listener is an object of context variables. You should use object destructuring to pick individual variables out of this object (e.g., { playbook }). The in-scope variables for each event are defined on the Generator Events Reference page. Let’s build on our extension to retrieve the site catalog and add a .nojekyll file to it as an alternative to using the supplemental UI for this purpose. Example 1. nojekyll-extension.js module.exports.register = function () { this.on('beforePublish', ({ siteCatalog }) => { siteCatalog.addFile({ contents: Buffer.alloc(0), out: { path: '.nojekyll' } }) }) } In Example 1, the site catalog is retrieved from the context using { siteCatalog }. To retrieve multiple variables, separate the variable names using commas (e.g., { playbook, siteCatalog }). Context variables can also be retrieved directly from the generator context using the getVariables method: const { siteCatalog } = this.getVariables() In addition to the built-in context variables, your extension can also access context variables documented and published by other extensions. While most extensions read context variables and interact with the methods of the referenced object, they can also add or replace context variables. One use case is to define new variables that other extensions or listeners of the same extension can access. This is one way to pass additional data through the generator. Another use case is to replace a built-in variable used by the generator, perhaps by proxying it. You may want to do this if you need to drastically alter Antora’s behavior and you can’t do it by adding or removed files from a catalog. Let’s consider the use case where we want to proxy the content catalog to prevent it from registering any aliases. In Example 2, we listen for the contentClassified event, retrieve the contentCatalog context variable, and replace the variable with a proxy of the object. Example 2. Replace variable with a proxy of the object module.exports.register = function () { this.on('contentClassified', function ({ contentCatalog }) { contentCatalog = new Proxy(contentCatalog, { get(target, property) { return property === 'registerPageAlias' ? () => undefined : target[property] }, }) this.updateVariables({ contentCatalog }) }) } Example 2 gives you the starting point to replace the registerPageAlias function with your own implementation. Notice that the previous example uses the formal function keyword to declare the listener instead of an arrow function. Defining the function this way gives us access to the standard this keyword, which is a reference to the generator context. When the listener is registered, Antora binds the function to the generator context, making the generator context accessible within the function using the standard this keyword. Once a built-in context variable is deemed established, which is typically after the event in which it was introduced is emitted, that variable becomes locked. There are exceptions to this rule, but by-in-large it holds. A variable that is locked can’t be replaced. Any attempt to do so results in an error. The built-in variables that are locked, and when they’re locked, are indicated on the Generator Events Reference page. The reason built-in variables are locked is two fold. First, it signals when a variable should be replaced if it must be. Second, it allows the site generator and other extensions to store a local reference to that variable without having to worry about checking whether it was replaced. A locked variable only prevents that variable itself from being replaced. It’s still possible to modify the object that the variable references, such as to add, update, or remove a property of the object. The one exception is the playbook, which is a frozen object.","title":"Use Context Variables","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"use-context-variables","url":"/antora/3.1/extend/use-context-variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Access context variables","hash":"access","id":1},{"text":"Update context variables","hash":"update","id":2},{"text":"Context variable locking","hash":"locking","id":3}]},"119":{"id":119,"text":"To generate and publish documentation sites with Antora, you need the Antora command line interface (CLI) and the official Antora site generator or a custom one. This page explains how to install Antora using its default configuration. Assumptions: You’ve installed an active Node.js LTS release on your Linux, Windows, or macOS machine. On this page, you’ll learn: How to run Antora without installing it. How to install Antora locally (recommended). How to install the Antora CLI and site generator packages globally. If you’re just evaluating Antora, you can use npx to run it without having to install it first. $ npx antora -v The npx command, provided by Node.js, can run a command directly from a local or remote npm package. If any required packages are not present in the local project dependencies, npx will install them into a cache folder (typically $HOME/.npm/_npx) before running the command. If the name of the command matches the name of the package that provides it, you don’t have to specify the package name. In this case, the antora package, which bundles the CLI and site generator, provides the antora command and the dependencies it needs to run. Using npx without installing any packages is only intended for evaluation, and only works when using Antora by itself. Once you need additional packages, you’ll need to install them along with Antora before running npx. You’ll see later that we recommend using the npx command to run Antora whenever you have installed it locally. When we say “locally” on this page, we mean within the playbook project (i.e., the directory where the playbook file for the site is located) or any parent folder. We recommend installing Antora locally, especially if you’re managing several documentation sites. Installing Antora locally makes it easier to manage the version of Antora and ensures that the version of Antora matches the version for which the playbook was made. It also avoids any permission problems you may run into when trying to install Antora globally. When we say “globally” on this page, it doesn’t necessarily imply system-wide. Rather, it means the location where Node.js is installed. If you used nvm to install Node.js, this location will be inside your home directory (thus not requiring elevated permissions). We only recommend installing Antora globally if you’re familiar with how Antora works and are comfortable with this setup. Your best chance for success is to install Antora locally. At the very least, you should start there. To install Antora locally, begin by switching to the directory of your playbook project (creating it, if necessary). We’ll assume here that the name of this folder is docs-site. $ cd docs-site Next, let’s install the CLI package within the playbook project so you can run the antora command using npx. $ node -e \"fs.writeFileSync('package.json', '{}')\" $ npm i -D -E @antora/cli@3.1 As an alternative to the first command, you can use npm init -y. However, npm init adds a lot of extra keys that you may not need. The @antora/cli package and its dependencies will be installed into the node_modules folder inside your playbook project. The optional -D option tells npm to save the package as a development dependency in package.json. The -E option tells npm to store the exact version in package.json rather than prefixing it with a semver range operator. The @ at the beginning of the package name informs npm that the cli package is located under the @antora scope. If you omit this character, npm will assume the package name is the name of a git repository on GitHub. The second @ in the package name designates the start of the requested version number. Except for prerelease versions, you can specify the major and minor segments only (e.g., @3.1), which ensures you retrieve the latest patch release. When you install Antora locally, the antora command is not placed on your PATH. Instead, you run the antora command using npx (i.e., npx antora). Verify the antora command is available through npx by running npx antora -v. $ npx antora -v This command should report the version of the Antora CLI in the terminal. @antora/cli: 3.1.9 @antora/site-generator: not installed The npx command will look for the antora command installed within the playbook project or any parent directory of the playbook project. If you’re prompted to install the antora package, then the CLI was not found. If you’re using Bash, you can save some typing by creating an alias for npx antora named antora: $ alias antora='npx antora' Now you can run antora without having to remember to prefix it with npx: $ antora -v You can bypass this alias by prefixing the command with a backslash, which will search for antora on your PATH instead. $ \\antora -v Although npx finds the antora command and reports the CLI version, we’re still missing the site generator. Next, install the site generator package within the playbook project: $ npm i -D -E @antora/site-generator@3.1 The @antora/site-generator package and its dependencies will be installed into the node_modules folder inside your playbook project. Antora’s CLI will look for the site generator package in this folder first before looking in the global installation folder. Now when you run npx antora -v, you should see the version of both the Antora CLI and the site generator printed in the terminal. @antora/cli: 3.1.9 @antora/site-generator: 3.1.9 If you open package.json, you’ll see the version of these packages listed there too, as development dependencies. { \"devDependencies\": { \"@antora/cli\": \"3.1.9\", \"@antora/site-generator\": \"3.1.9\" } } You’ll also notice an additional file named package-lock.json. This file stores the resolved version of all packages and their dependencies. You may choose to commit this file when you commit package.json. If you’re reinstalling Antora, it’s best to first remove the node_modules folder. If you also want to get the latest version of each dependency, remove the package-lock.json file as well. If you remove the node_modules folder, be sure to install the CLI package again. Another option is to use npm ci, which will automatically remove node_modules when reinstalling. If the antora command reports the version of both the CLI and the site generator, and those versions match, that confirms you have installed Antora correctly. You have the option of installing Antora globally so that the antora command is available on your PATH. To install Antora globally, pass the -g option to npm i. $ npm i -g @antora/cli@3.1 @antora/site-generator@3.1 Verify the antora command is available on your PATH by running: $ antora -v If installation was successful, the command should report the version of the Antora CLI and site generator. $ antora -v @antora/cli: 3.1.9 @antora/site-generator: 3.1.9 The benefit of installing Antora globally is that it is always available in your terminal, no matter what directory you are in. While this may seem convenient at first, there are problems with this strategy. The version of Antora you have installed may not match the version of Antora for which the documentation site was made. And there’s no way for Antora or the documentation site to verify these are the same. So you may end up running into esoteric problems and find yourself struggling to get them in sync. Installing Antora locally and running it using npx will give you the best chance for success and compatibility. If you’re using a system-wide Node.js installation managed by your operating system’s package manager, you may run into permission problems when installing packages globally. In that case, you’ll need to install Antora directly in your project repository. Now that Antora is installed, you’re ready to: Set up your own playbook or use the Demo playbook. Organize your content source files and repositories or use Antora’s Demo content repositories. Run Antora and generate a documentation site.","title":"Install Antora","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"install-antora","url":"/antora/3.1/install/install-antora.html","titles":[{"text":"Try before you install","hash":"try-before-you-install","id":1},{"text":"Locally vs globally","hash":"locally-vs-globally","id":2},{"text":"Install Antora locally","hash":"install-dir","id":3},{"text":"Install Antora globally","hash":"install-antora-globally","id":4},{"text":"Learn more","hash":"learn-more","id":5}]},"120":{"id":120,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: How to install Node.js.

Thanks to this broad platform support, Antora is also used on many cloud platforms and continuous integration and delivery servers. Our general policy is to align Antora’s support of a platform version with the upstream project’s lifecycle schedule for that version. When a platform version reaches the end of active support by its maintainers or its end of life (EOL)—​which ever comes first—​Antora no longer supports it.

You could say we’re just a teeny-tiny bit obsessed with writing high quality tests and improving test coverage. Antora should operate as designed on common cloud platforms. How you provision your cloud instance depends on your workload requirements and remote git repository sizes. If you’re running Antora on a cloud platform, we would love to hear about your experience in Antora’s community chat. Your hardware requirements will depend primarily on the size of the remote git repositories your Antora pipeline fetches content from when it is generating your site. The first time Antora runs, it fetches and clones all of the remote git repositories specified in a playbook. The speed of this operation is dictated by the size of the remote repositories, environment input/output parameters, and network performance. After the initial run, Antora caches the repositories locally. On subsequent runs, Antora only reconnects to the remote repositories if the fetch option is enabled or the cache folder is removed. RAM Memory requirements depend on the size of your Git repositories. 3GB should provide sufficient headroom. I/O Maximum throughput and minimum latency always make things nicer but aren’t required. Even if the machine you’re using has sufficient memory (RAM), not all that memory will be allocated to the Node.js process. If the Node.js process tries to use more memory than is allocated to it, the system may terminate the Node.js process (SIGKILL). Node.js starts with a conservative memory limit (typically 2048 MiB, but it depends on the system). You can allocate more memory to the Node.js process using the --max-old-space-size CLI option. You can pass this option to Node.js when running Antora using the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable. NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=4096\" You’ll need to experiment with this value to find the setting that works best for your site. Refer to How do I determine the correct \"max-old-space-size\" for Node.js? for more information on this topic. Upgrade to the latest Antora release.

If you’re already on Antora 3.0 and ready to upgrade to Antora 3.1, skip the next section and go directly to Upgrade Node.js. Antora 2 is EOL. If you’re currently using Antora 2, you may need to make the following changes to your documentation system before upgrading to Antora 3.1. If you’re already using Antora 3.0, skip this section and go to Upgrade Node.js. Are you using an active LTS version of Node.js? We recommend upgrading to the latest active long term support (LTS) release of Node. Antora 3 officially supports Node.js 16 LTS and Node.js 18 LTS. Antora 3 doesn’t support Node.js versions that have reached end of life (EOL). See Upgrade Node.js for instructions. Have you updated your AsciiDoc syntax and Asciidoctor extensions to comply with the newest patch release of Asciidoctor.js 2.2? Antora 3 dropped support for Asciidoctor.js 1.5.9 (which provides Asciidoctor 1.5.8) and now depends on the latest patch version of Asciidoctor.js 2.2 (which provides Asciidoctor 2.0.x). Asciidoctor 2 introduces a few substantive changes to existing features that may impact your documentation source content or UI. See Asciidoctor Upgrade Notes to learn about the affected features and the suggested actions you should take before upgrading to Antora 3. Are you linking to attachment files? Using the AsciiDoc link macro (link:[]) and {attachmentsdir} attribute reference in the target value to reference an attachment has been deprecated in Antora 3. Replace the link macro with the xref macro and use the attachment’s resource ID to reference it. See Attachments and Attachment Xrefs in Navigation Files to learn about the attachment$ family coordinate and for usage examples. Are any of your component versions unversioned? We’ve deprecated the use of the value master, when assigned to the version key, to identify an unversioned component. In Antora 3, assign the tilde (~) to the version key in a component version’s antora.yml file to specify it as unversioned. See Define a Component with No Version to learn more. Make sure you’re using file extensions when cross referencing pages or assigning page-aliases values. If the .adoc file extension was missing from the resource ID in an xref macro or the value assigned to a page-aliases attribute, Antora 2 would automatically add .adoc to the resource ID at runtime. This fallback mechanism has been deprecated because the xref macro can now reference other non-AsciiDoc resources. Review the resource IDs in your xrefs and page-aliases attributes to ensure the .adoc extension is specified. Are you depending on the default branches pattern in your playbook? The previous default branches pattern, [master, v*], has been deprecated and replaced with [HEAD, v{0..9}*]. It’s unlikely this will cause a change when using remote repositories. For local repositories, it may result in the worktree being used in cases it wasn’t previously. Do you use the antora-lunr add-on to integrate Lunr into your site? The antora-lunr add-on was designed for Antora 2 and is a community-maintained project. In Antora 3, antora-lunr has been replaced by the Antora Lunr extension (package: @antora/lunr-extension), which is an official Antora project. This extension uses the new extension facility in Antora 3 to integrate Lunr into your site without having to resort to using a custom site generator. We encourage you to migrate from antora-lunr to the Antora Lunr Extension when upgrading to Antora 3. Do you use or maintain a custom site generator? In Antora 3, the site generator must declare the @antora/logger package as a dependency. The CLI resolves the logger relative to the site generator. If it cannot find it there, it will fall back to the logger provided by the CLI. This may result in Antora configuring the wrong logger, which will result in the user to see a warning about the logger not being configured. Also note that the recommended signature of the generateSite function has changed. The function now accepts a single parameter, the playbook. The old signature is still supported, but using it will result in the playbook being built a second time. The site generator should also depend on the @antora/file-publisher package instead of @antora/site-publisher, though technically this isn’t required. Do you use a custom git credential manager? Isomorphic-git no longer includes the cores (plugin) API, so the call git.cores.create('antora').set('credentialManager', customCredentialManager) is going to fail. Antora still honors the cores API, but the call to register the credential manager is now responsible for creating it (since it runs before Antora loads). Refer to Configure a custom credential manager for the latest instructions. You can use any active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js with Antora, but we recommend using the most recent active LTS version so that you benefit from the latest performance and security enhancements. The Node.js release schedule shows the active Node.js LTS versions. To check which Node.js version you have installed, open a terminal and run: $ node --version If you need to upgrade to the active Node.js LTS version, run: Linux and macOS $ nvm install --lts Windows $ nvm install 16.20.2 Next, to set the latest version of Node.js as the default for any new terminal, run: Linux and macOS $ nvm alias default 16 Windows $ nvm alias default 16.20.2 Now you’re ready to upgrade to the latest version of Antora. If you have installed Antora locally, you will use package.json to manage the version. This file tracks which version of Antora you currently have installed. You can use the file to specify a different version. The npm i command will consult this file to determine which packages and which versions of those packages to install. Switch to your playbook project where your Antora playbook file (e.g., antora-playbook.yml) is stored. Open the package.json file. Change the version number of the CLI and site generator. { \"devDependencies\": { \"@antora/cli\": \"3.1.9\", \"@antora/site-generator\": \"3.1.9\" } } Unless you’re installing a prerelease, we recommend specifying only the major.minor version number so you receive the latest patch update. Save the file. (Optional) Remove the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file. Although removing the node_modules folder is not always required, doing so ensures you get a fresh installation. If you’re using at least npm 8, this step is usually unnecessary. Upgrade the site generator by running the npm i command. $ npm i You’ve now upgraded to the latest version of Antora. As an alternative to removing the node_modules folder, you can use npm upgrade, which closely mimics a fresh installation. If you installed the Antora CLI and site generator globally, you can upgrade them by reinstalling the packages: In a terminal, run: $ npm i -g @antora/cli@3.1 @antora/site-generator@3.1 The npm i command will remove any existing packages with the same name and install them anew. Do I have Antora installed globally?

Since Node.js is distributed for and runs on Windows, that means Antora runs on Windows without any additional requirements. On this page, you’ll learn: How to install Chocolatey, the Windows package manager. How to install Node.js. If you’ve never installed Antora before, you’ll need to complete the steps on this page before you can install Antora and use it to generate a documentation site. Since Antora is built on Node.js, you’ll need Node.js (commands: node, npm, and npx) installed on your machine to install and run Antora. You can use any active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js with Antora, but we recommend using the most recent active LTS version so that you benefit from the latest performance and security enhancements. The Node.js release schedule shows the active Node.js LTS versions. To see if you have Node.js installed, and which version, open PowerShell and type: $ node --version You should see a version string, such as: v16.20.2 If the command fails with an error, you don’t have Node.js installed. The best way to install Node.js on Windows is to use Chocolatey. If you don’t have Chocolatey on your machine, go to install Chocolatey to get it set up. Otherwise, skip directly to install nvm and Node. If the command returns a version that isn’t an active LTS version, upgrade to the active Node.js LTS version using nvm. If the command returns an active Node.js LTS version, you’re all set to install Antora. The best way to install the Node Version Manager (nvm) and Node.js is with Chocolatey, the package manager for Windows. Open a PowerShell terminal and run it as an Administrator by right clicking on the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator. Type the following command in the terminal: $ Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')) You’re now ready to install nvm and Node.js. Open a PowerShell terminal, right click on the PowerShell icon, and select Run as Administrator. If you just installed Chocolatey using the instructions in the proceeding section, use the same terminal (running as Administrator) that you already have open. To install the Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows, enter the following command in the terminal: $ choco install -y nvm Close the terminal. Open a new, regular PowerShell terminal, and install Node.js using nvm. $ nvm install 16.20.2 When using nvm for Windows, you must enter an exact version of Node.js (e.g., 16.20.2) until nvm-windows#214 is resolved. Now that Node.js is installed, you’re ready to install Antora. nvm and CI environments You can install the LTS release of Node.js directly, without installing nvm, by entering the following command in the Administrator PowerShell: $ choco install -y nodejs-lts However, many CI environments use nvm to install the Node.js version used for the build job. By using nvm, you closely align your setup with the environment used to generate and publish your production site. If you have nvm installed but your Node.js version is not an active LTS release, type the following command in your terminal: $ nvm install 16.20.2 When using nvm for Windows, you must enter the full version of Node.js (i.e., nvm install 16.20.2).

That means visitors can find a page using search tools, links on other site pages, and in some scenarios, through dropdown menus such as the page version selector. In order for visitors to locate and go to a page using a component version page menu, a cross reference targeting that page must be entered into a list in a navigation file. A navigation file is one or more lists of page cross references, external URLs, and other content that is marked up in AsciiDoc and stored at the base of a module directory. If registered in an antora.yml file, the contents of the navigation file will be incorporated into a component version page menu and published to a site. Navigation files must end with the AsciiDoc file extension (.adoc). They’re typically named nav.adoc; however, you can use any name that is meaningful to you. Name your navigation files kaboom.adoc if that makes your team happy. A navigation list is an unordered AsciiDoc list. Each top-level list item can nested items up to level five (*****). Example 1. Single list structure * Top level item ** Second level item *** Third level item *** Third level item ** Second level item *** Third level item **** Fourth level item ***** Fifth level item * Top level item * Top level item A top-level list item is a list title, which is denoted by a dot (.), or, when there isn’t a list title, each list item that’s marked by a single asterisk (*). When a file contains multiple lists, each list must be initiated with a list title. Example 2. Multiple list structure .List title and top level item * List item .List title and top level item * List item ** List item If a navigation file only contains one list, a list title is optional. In a single list navigation file, each item with a single asterisk marker (*) effectively becomes a top-level item. You can compose your navigation by combining files using the include directive. Each included file must be located in a partials directory. If you want the navigation list in the included file to be added as a child of the current item, you should enclose the include directive in an open block. See Compose Navigation Files to learn how to create a navigation list using multiple files and include directives. List titles and items in a navigation file can contain several types of content, such as cross references to pages, links to external sites, and regular and formatted text.

(Antora does not classify files located at the root of the module or in the modules folder). Let’s assume that one of the navigation lists is defined in the file modules/ROOT/partials/getting-started.adoc. Example 1. modules/ROOT/partials/getting-started.adoc .Getting Started * xref:download.adoc[] * xref:install.adoc[] * xref:run.adoc[] You can include this partial navigation file into the main navigation file, modules/ROOT/nav.adoc, as follows: Example 2. modules/ROOT/nav.adoc .Overview * xref:index.adoc[] * xref:contribute.adoc[] include::partial$getting-started.adoc[] The Getting Started list will be read from the partial file and included in the navigation after the Overview list.

The navigation for a site requires: at least one navigation file that contains at least one unordered AsciiDoc list, at least one navigation file registered in the component version descriptor file, and a UI bundle, such as Antora’s reference UI, that can apply styles and interaction behavior to the menus Antora generates. Let’s take a brief look at each of the numbered items in this diagram. The navigation for a component version is described by at least one AsciiDoc file. However, as you can see in the diagram, you can assemble a component version’s navigation from multiple files. Creating a navigation file per module is a common organizational structure, but it isn’t required. A navigation file contains one or more bulleted lists. Each item in a list can be the cross reference to a page, URL to a website that isn’t part of the site, or unlinked text such as a category title that groups a nested set of list items. You can compose the navigation from multiple files. When you want the contents of a navigation file to be published to a component version’s page menu, you need to register the file in the corresponding component version descriptor file. Navigation files are registered in a component version descriptor file under the nav key. List the navigation files in the order you want them to be displayed in the published component version page menu on your site. When Antora runs, it only uses the registered navigation files to create the component version page menu. Antora collects the contents of each registered navigation file, puts the contents in the order the files are listed under the nav key, and publishes a fully assembled menu of pages for the component version. The behavior and style of the component version page menu is dictated by the UI bundle specified in your playbook. When your site has several components or component versions, Antora assembles an aggregated list of the components and their versions. This menu of components and their component versions is the component version selector. Antora automatically lists the components in alphabetical order. Each component version is ordered from the greatest or latest. In the reference UI, this list is displayed in the “drawer” located at the bottom of any component version page menu. When a visitor clicks on the drawer, it expands upwards and the reader can then select the component version they want to see. If a page is available in more than one version of a component, a dropdown selector is visible on that page in the reference UI. From this selector, a visitor can navigate between other versions of that page. Antora automatically populates this selector when multiple versions of a page are available.","title":"Navigation Assembly","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"index","url":"/antora/3.1/navigation/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Navigation assembly requirements","hash":"navigation-assembly-requirements","id":1},{"text":" Navigation files (Source)","hash":"navigation-files-source","id":2},{"text":" Navigation registration (Source)","hash":"navigation-registration-source","id":3},{"text":" Component version page menu (Site)","hash":"component-menu","id":4},{"text":" Component version selector (Site)","hash":"component-dropdown","id":5},{"text":" Page version selector (Site)","hash":"page-dropdown","id":6}]},"130":{"id":130,"text":"A navigation file can contain more than one unordered AsciiDoc lists.

The most common items in a navigation list are xrefs to pages that belong to the same module as the navigation file. The exercise below assumes that the navigation file will belong to the same component version and module as the pages it is referencing.

Modules already represent logical groups of concepts or objectives, so it’s likely that you’d arrange the xrefs to that module’s pages into a continuous, hierarchical flow of navigation menu entries. This also reduces the number of coordinates the resource IDs in the xrefs require when you add a page to the navigation file. Navigation files should be stored at the base of a module directory, i.e., at the same level as a pages family directory. Don’t save navigation files inside a pages folder, otherwise the navigation files will be converted to pages and published as pages. A module directory can contain more than one navigation file. This functionality helps you finely tune the navigation list order when you register the navigation files in an antora.yml file. Storing a navigation file in the module it references simplifies the page cross references entered into it. It also helps writers locate the navigation that’s affected when they add pages to or remove pages from a module. However, xrefs to other modules’ pages (and even other component versions’ pages) can be entered into any module’s navigation file. You just need to add the module coordinate (or component name and version coordinates) to the cross references you create in the navigation file. For example, you could store a single navigation file in a component version’s ROOT module, and, instead of having navigation files in each module in the component version, you could just add the cross references to pages in those other modules directly to the ROOT module’s navigation file.","title":"Navigation File Locations","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"organize-files","url":"/antora/3.1/navigation/organize-files.html","titles":[{"text":"File location","hash":"storage","id":1},{"text":"Multiple files per module","hash":"multiple-files-per-module","id":2},{"text":"Alternative storage patterns","hash":"alternative-storage-patterns","id":3}]},"132":{"id":132,"text":"To reference an attachment, use the AsciiDoc xref macro and the resource ID of the attachment.

The link text is displayed in the component version’s page menu. When a visitor clicks on the link text, they’re routed to the target page specified by the resource ID in the xref. The link text, regardless of whether it’s the default link text or specified in the xref, is also displayed in the breadcrumbs at the top of the target page. Xrefs in a navigation file don’t need to specify link text. Example 2. nav.adoc * xref:get-started.adoc[] (1) 1 Xref that doesn’t have any link text specified inside the macro’s square brackets ([]). Antora uses the value assigned to the optional navtitle attribute in the target page when the link text is unspecified. When navtitle isn’t set in the target page’s header, Antora automatically assigns it the value of the page’s reference text, which may either be the target page’s default reference text or text assigned to the reftext attribute. Antora doesn’t populate an xref’s link text when a fragment is appended to the resource ID of a page. In such cases, you still need to explicitly specify the link text. You can enter link text directly in the xref macro and override the default link text supplied by the target page. Example 3. nav.adoc .The Special Project * xref:index.adoc[What's Silver Leaf] (1) ** xref:ROOT:get-started.adoc#prereqs[Installation Prerequisites] (2) ** xref:team::contributing.adoc[] (3) .Support * xref:help.adoc[*Troubleshooting*] (4) 1 Enter the link text between the xref macro’s square brackets ([]). 2 Xrefs where the target page’s resource ID is appended with a fragment should specify link text. 3 This xref will use the target page’s default navigation link text. 4 Specified link text can be marked up with inline formatting syntax. The link text specified in the xref macros will be displayed in the component version page menu.","title":"Page Xrefs and Link Text in Navigation Files","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"xrefs-and-link-text","url":"/antora/3.1/navigation/xrefs-and-link-text.html","titles":[{"text":"Page xrefs","hash":"page-xrefs","id":1},{"text":"Use the default navigation link text","hash":"default-link-text","id":2},{"text":"Specify link text in an xref","hash":"specify-link-text-in-an-xref","id":3}]},"136":{"id":136,"text":"Attachments are downloadable resources, such as PDFs or the ZIP archives of sample projects, that are stored in an attachments family directory. Although not as common, an example file can be promoted to an attachment to make it downloadable as well. An attachment can be cross referenced from pages, other resources, and navigation files using an AsciiDoc xref macro and the attachment’s resource ID. Example 1 shows the structure of an xref macro with an attachment’s fully qualified resource ID. Example 1. Xref macro structure for referencing an attachment xref:version@component:module:attachment$file-coordinate-of-attachment.ext[optional link text] At a minimum, an xref macro consists of the macro’s prefix (xref:), the resource ID of the target attachment, and a set of square brackets ([]). The target attachment is the attachment source file that’s being referenced by the current page. The target attachment is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an xref macro in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the xref macro that references the target attachment. When referencing an attachment, the xref macro is structured and behaves much like when it’s assigned the resource ID of a page, with three differences: The resource ID of an attachment must specify the attachment$ family coordinate when an attachment is assigned to an xref macro, otherwise Antora will assume the resource ID is that of a page at runtime. A fragment (element ID) can’t be appended to the end of the attachment’s resource ID. Attachments don’t have default reference text. If link text isn’t specified in the xref macro, the target of the xref is displayed as the link text. How many of the target attachment’s resource ID coordinates you need to specify depends on the component version and module of the target attachment in relation to the current page. Let’s break down the xref macro and resource ID coordinates you need to create a cross reference to an attachment (the target attachment) from a page that you’re currently editing (the current page). In your IDE or text editor, open the page where you want to create a cross reference to an attachment. For this step and the subsequent steps, let’s assume you’ve opened the source file for a page named satellites.adoc. satellites.adoc is the current page. Example 2. satellites.adoc (current page) = System Satellites The group maintains five satellites. Select the place in the content flow of the current page where you want the link to the target attachment to be displayed. Enter the name of the xref macro followed by one colon, xref:. Example 3. satellites.adoc (current page) The group maintains five satellites. See the xref: Let’s reference the source file of an attachment with the filename flight-patterns.pdf. Both flight-patterns.pdf and satellites.adoc belong to the same component version and module. Therefore, only the attachment$ family coordinate and file coordinate of the target attachment needs to be assigned to the xref macro in Example 4. Directly after the macro’s prefix, enter the resource ID of the target attachment. Example 4. satellites.adoc (current page) The group maintains five satellites. See the xref:attachment$flight-patterns.pdf The file coordinate for flight-patterns.pdf consists solely of its filename and file extension because it’s stored at the root of the attachments directory. The target attachment’s file coordinate is always calculated from the root of the attachments family directory where the attachment is stored. If the target attachment is stored in a subdirectory of an attachments directory, its file coordinate must specify the attachments-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. (See Example 8 for an example.) Directly after the resource ID of the target attachment, enter an opening square bracket ([), then a closing square bracket (]). Example 5. satellites.adoc (current page) The group maintains five satellites. See the xref:attachment$flight-patterns.pdf[] Let’s add some link text to the xref macro because, unlike pages, attachments don’t have default reference text. Between the macro’s square brackets, specify the text you want displayed as a link to the target attachment when the current page is published. Example 6. satellites.adoc (current page) The group maintains five satellites. See the xref:attachment$flight-patterns.pdf[flight pattern schedule] Link text is optional. See Link text for attachments for more information. After the closing square bracket (]) of the xref macro, continue entering your content. Example 7. satellites.adoc (current page) The group maintains five satellites. See the xref:attachment$flight-patterns.pdf[flight pattern schedule] for more details. That’s it! You’ve created a cross reference to the target attachment, flight-patterns.pdf, from the current page, satellites.adoc, using the AsciiDoc xref macro. While the previous steps use a target attachment and current page that belong to the same component version and module, you can reference any attachment in your site, regardless of the component version and module it belongs to, from any page. You’ll need to specify additional resource ID coordinates when the target attachment and current page don’t belong to the same module or component version. Example 8. Resource ID patterns for a target attachment in relation to a current page xref:attachment$target-attachment-filename.ext[link text] (1) xref:attachment$path/to/target-attachment-filename.ext[link text] (2) xref:attachment$./target-attachment-filename.ext[link text] (3) xref:module:attachment$file-coordinate-of-attachment.ext[link text] (4) xref:version@component:module:attachment$file-coordinate-of-attachment.ext[link text] (5) xref:component:module:attachment$file-coordinate-of-attachment.ext[link text] (6) xref:version@module:attachment$file-coordinate-of-attachment.ext[link text] (7) xref:version@attachment$file-coordinate-of-attachment.ext[link text] (8) 1 Assign the attachment$ family coordinate and file coordinate of the target attachment to the xref macro when the target attachment and current page belong to the same component version and module. The target attachment’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when the target attachment is stored at the root of an attachments family directory. 2 If the target attachment is stored in a subdirectory of an attachments directory, the target attachment’s file coordinate must specify its attachments-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. 3 The file coordinate of the target attachment can be abbreviated with the relative path token (./) when the target attachment and current page are stored in subdirectories with parallel family-relative directory paths. This is an advanced use case. 4 Assign the module, attachment$, and file coordinates of the target attachment to the xref macro when the target attachment and current page don’t belong to the same module, but they do belong to the same component version. 5 Assign the version, component, module, attachment$, and file coordinates of the target attachment to the xref macro when the target attachment and current page don’t belong to the same component version. 6 If the version coordinate isn’t specified, Antora uses the latest version of the target attachment’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target attachment and current page don’t belong to the same component version. 7 Assign the version, module, attachment$, and file coordinates of the target attachment to the xref macro when the target attachment doesn’t belong to the same version and module as the current page, but it does belong to the same component as the current page. 8 Assign the version, attachment$, and file coordinates of the target attachment to the xref macro when the target attachment doesn’t belong to the same version as the current page, but it does belong to the same component and module as the current page. Attachment links and page links share many similarities. See Create Page Links for more examples that show how to construct the resource ID of the target resource when it doesn’t belong to the same module, component version, or version as the current page. Just remember to always add the attachment$ family coordinate to the target attachment’s resource ID when you assign it to an xref macro. You can specify link text between the square brackets of an AsciiDoc xref macro, or you can leave the square brackets of the xref macro empty. Example 9 shows an xref macro that’s assigned the resource ID of an attachment. No link text has been specified between the xref macro’s square brackets. Example 9. Xref macro without specified link text Download xref:attachment$practice-project.zip[] to try it out! Because the xref macro in Example 9 isn’t assigned link text, Antora will display the xref target as the link text. Download attachment$practice-project.zip to try it out! Unlike pages, attachments don’t have default reference text, so it’s always good to specify link text to ensure a good reader experience. You can specify link text by entering it between the square brackets of the xref macro. Example 10. Xref macro with specified link text Download xref:attachment$practice-project.zip[the sample project] to try it out! When link text is specified in the xref macro, Antora displays the specified content as the link to the attachment in the published page. Instead of linking to an attachment, you can include it into an AsciiDoc page or partial using the include directive. The only restriction is that the file must be a text file. Storing a text file as an attachment allows it to be included while still being downloadable. Here’s the full syntax that shows how to include the text of an attachment into a page. include::version@component:module:attachment$name-of-file.ext[optional attributes] The attachment$ segment tells Antora to look for the file in the attachments folder. If the attachment lives in the same component version and module as the page, the target can start with the attachment$ segment. include::attachment$name-of-file.ext[optional attributes] You can use the same attachment in both an xref macro and an include directive. You can also create links to attachments in navigation files and from image macros.","title":"Attachments","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"attachments","url":"/antora/3.1/page/attachments.html","titles":[{"text":"AsciiDoc xref macro for attachments","hash":"asciidoc-xref-macro-for-attachments","id":1},{"text":"Make a link to an attachment","hash":"make-link","id":2},{"text":"Link text for attachments","hash":"link-text","id":3},{"text":"Include an attachment","hash":"include-attachment","id":4},{"text":"Learn more","hash":"learn-more","id":5}]},"137":{"id":137,"text":"Like the AsciiDoc processor, Antora uses AsciiDoc document attributes (herein attributes) to circulate information in and out of pages. These attributes are used to toggle or configure processing settings, control behavior and styles of the output, pass metadata from the source to the UI templates, and pass down information about the page to the content, among a variety of other uses. In general, there are two kinds of attributes: built-in and custom. Attributes can also be divided into those that are page attributes and those that are not. This page introduces these attribute categories and refers you to additional pages to learn about how they’re defined and used. Built-in attributes are AsciiDoc document attributes that either pass information to the page or provide a way for the author to toggle or configure behavior. Some built-in attributes are read-only, while others are meant to be modified. Built-in attributes have reserved names and serve a special, predefined purpose. For example, the idseparator attribute is used to control the word separator for auto-generated section IDs. Although the purpose of a built-in attribute is restricted, like all AsciiDoc attributes, its value can be displayed on the page using an attribute reference (e.g., {idseparator}). Many modifiable built-in attributes have a restricted set of acceptable values. Each value represents either a predefined behavior or a boundary condition. For example, the xrefstyle attribute controls the style of the linked text of internal xrefs using the predefined values basic, short, or full. The max-include-depth attribute specifies how deep includes can be nested. The AsciiDoc processor defines numerous built-in attributes. Antora introduces additional built-in attributes that are specific to the Antora environment. The purpose of these attributes is to configure the AsciiDoc processor to work with Antora. In most cases, these attributes are prefixed with page-, which makes them intrinsic page attributes. Refer to Intrinsic attributes for a list of the read-only attributes defined by Antora. Refer to the AsciiDoc Document Attributes Reference for a list of all built-in attributes defined in AsciiDoc (though keep in mind that not all of them are relevant in the Antora environment). Custom attributes are AsciiDoc document attributes defined by the author. You may be familiar with using custom attributes in AsciiDoc to store reusable content, such as a URL or product name. The value of a custom attribute can then be used within the page (or across pages, depending on where it’s defined) using an attribute reference. Custom attributes work the same way in Antora. See Define a custom AsciiDoc attribute and Define a custom page attribute to learn how to define your own custom attributes. Where things get interesting is when the name of the attribute starts with page-. With this special designation, the attribute becomes a page attribute. To the AsciiDoc document, page attributes are just like any other AsciiDoc attribute. For example, you can refer to the component for the current page using built-in page attribute {page-version}. Or you can define your own page attribute named page-edition and refer to it in the page using {page-edition}. In this context, the page- prefix is not significant. Where this special designation comes into play is when the UI template is applied to the page’s contents. Page attributes get promoted to the page’s UI model so they can be accessed using the expression page.attributes. within a UI template (e.g., layouts/default.hbs). In effect, a page attribute allows the author to pass metadata defined using attributes either in the page’s header or in a configuration file (e.g., the Antora playbook), thus allowing that information to be used outside of the AsciiDoc document. It’s even possible to access page attributes from pages other than the current page in the UI template. Attributes that are not prefixed with page- are not accessible in this way (though it’s still possible to access all attributes using a UI helper). While page attributes are primarily custom attributes, Antora defines a handful of built-in page attributes to control Antora-specific features or get information about the current page. See Page Attributes to learn more about page attributes, and how to define and use them.","title":"AsciiDoc Attributes in Antora","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"attributes","url":"/antora/3.1/page/attributes.html","titles":[{"text":"Built-in attributes","hash":"built-in-attributes","id":1},{"text":"Custom attributes","hash":"custom-attributes","id":2},{"text":"Page attributes","hash":"page-attributes","id":3}]},"138":{"id":138,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: The structure of the AsciiDoc block image macro. How to insert a block image using its resource ID. An AsciiDoc block image macro is used to embed the source file of an image into a partial or page. The block image macro accepts the Antora resource ID of PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image files as a value. When Antora runs, the image file referenced by the block image macro is embedded and displayed as a discrete element in the published page. For example, the SVG image below this paragraph is embedded in this page using the block image macro. Example 1 shows the structure of a block image macro. Example 1. Block image macro This is a paragraph. image::resource-id-of-target-image.ext[optional attribute,optional attribute] (1) This is another paragraph. 1 A block image is designated by two colons (::) after the macro name. It’s preceded by an empty line, entered on a line by itself, and then followed by an empty line. At a minimum, a block image macro consists of the macro’s prefix (image::), the resource ID of the target image, and a set of square brackets ([]). The target image is the image source file that’s being referenced by the current page. The target image is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an inline or block image macro in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the image macro that references the target image. Each part of the block image macro shown in Example 1 is described in more detail below. image:: An block image macro begins with the macro’s name, image, followed by two colons (::). resource ID of target image The image macro accepts the resource ID of an image source file as its value. The value is entered directly after the second colon that follows the macro’s name (image::). How many of the target image’s resource ID coordinates you need to specify depends on the component version and module of the target image in relation to the current page. When referencing an image from an image macro, you don’t need to include the image$ family coordinate in the target image’s resource ID. It’s applied automatically at runtime. [optional attribute,optional attribute] The block image macro is completed with a set of square brackets ([]) at the end of the target image’s resource ID. You can leave the brackets empty, or assign one or more optional attributes as a comma-separated list inside the square brackets. The next section, Embed a block image, explains how to set up an block image macro step-by-step. Let’s break down the block image macro and resource ID coordinates you need to insert an image (the target image) into a page (the current page) using the block image macro. In your IDE or text editor, open the page where you want to insert an image. For this exercise, we’ve opened the file satellites.adoc. satellites.adoc is the current page. In satellites.adoc, let’s embed the block image console.svg. At the beginning of a new line, enter the macro’s name followed by two colons, image::. Make sure there is a blank line between the previous element, such as a paragraph or source block, and the line where you place the image macro. Example 2. satellites.adoc (current page) After scanning your badge, you should see this screen. image:: Enter the resource ID of the target image file directly after the two colons. In this example, both console.svg and satellites.adoc belong to the same component version and module and the target image is stored at the root of the images family directory. Therefore, only the filename and extension of console.svg needs to be assigned as the value of the block image macro. Example 3. satellites.adoc (current page) After scanning your badge, you should see this screen. image::console.svg Notice that the resource ID for console.svg doesn’t include its family coordinate. Antora automatically applies the image$ family coordinate to a resource ID assigned to an image macro. Directly after the resource ID of the target image, enter an opening square bracket ([) and then a closing square bracket (]). Example 4. satellites.adoc (current page) After scanning your badge, you should see this screen. image::console.svg[] We didn’t apply any optional attributes to the block image macro in this example; however, you can specify one or more attributes as a comma-separated list inside the square brackets. Press Enter twice after the last square bracket (]) to insert a new line after the image macro. Example 5. satellites.adoc (current page) After scanning your badge, you should see this screen. image::console.svg[] Enter the satellite position after the prompt. That’s it! You’ve finished inserting the target image (console.svg) into the current page (satellites.adoc) using the AsciiDoc block image macro.

The precedence matches that order (higher to lower) unless the precedence has been altered for a given attribute using a modifier. These different scopes give you the ability to define attributes at the level of granularity you need and to be able to override their values for different environments or situations. This page explains how to define and modify an attribute at the page level using an attribute entry. Alternately, these attributes can be set at a higher level using the CLI, playbook, or component descriptor. The result of defining or modifying an attribute is the same (meaning the processor doesn’t care how it’s defined). An attribute entry is the primary mechanism for defining an attribute for a page and, if applicable, assigning a value to it. You can think of an attribute entry like a global variable assignment in AsciiDoc. An attribute entry consists of two parts: a name and a value. Each attribute entry must be entered on its own line in a page header. An attribute entry starts with an opening colon (:), directly followed by the attribute’s name, and then a closing colon (:). This activates, or sets, the attribute so you can use it in your page. = Page Title :name-of-an-attribute: (1) 1 The attribute’s name is directly preceded with a opening colon (:) and directly followed by a closing colon (:). In many cases, you explicitly assign a value to an attribute by entering information after its name in the attribute entry. The value must be offset from the closing colon (:) by at least one space. = Page Title :name-of-an-attribute: value of the attribute (1) 1 An explicitly assigned value is offset from the closing colon (:) by at least one blank space. At the end of the value, press Enter. Some built-in AsciiDoc attributes don’t require a value to be explicitly assigned in an attribute entry because they’re a boolean attribute or have a default value. = Page Title :name-of-an-attribute: (1) 1 If you don’t want to explicitly assign a value to the attribute, press Enter after the closing colon (:). The values of built-in boolean attributes are always blank because their only accepted value is an empty string. Other built-in attributes may have a default value. If you set a built-in attribute and leave its value blank, Antora assigns the default value (if it has one) to the attribute at processing time. Let’s activate the AsciiDoc attribute named sectanchors. The attribute is set by entering its name in an attribute entry in the header of the page. Example 1. Set a built-in attribute = Page Title :sectanchors: (1) 1 The attribute is set in page header by directly preceding its name, sectanchors, with an opening colon (:) and directly following it with a closing colon (:). When set, sectanchors adds an anchor to the left of each section title. sectanchors is a boolean attribute, so its value is an empty string. In the next example, let’s assign a value to a built-in AsciiDoc attribute. The attribute xrefstyle has three built-in values it can accept, short, full, and basic. = Page Title :xrefstyle: short (1) 1 Set xrefstyle in the page header and assign it the value short. Explicit values must be offset from the closing colon (:) by at least one space. When the short value is assigned to xrefstyle, any in-page references to blocks with anchors will display the blocks’ label and number, e.g., Listing 1, if no link text is specified in the reference. Some built-in AsciiDoc attributes are not applicable in the Antora environment. These attributes include data-uri, allow-uri-read, docinfo, linkcss, noheader, nofooter, webfonts, and outfilesuffix. Setting these attributes either has no effect or may cause Antora to malfunction. Other attributes, such as imagesdir, are automatically set by Antora and cannot be overridden. Custom attributes often store frequently used text and URLs. They’re then referenced throughout the page by simply entering their name (instead of repeatedly typing the text or URLs). Before they can be referenced, custom attributes must have a user-defined name and be assigned a value. The attribute’s name must: be at least one character long, begin with a word character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _), and only contain word characters and hyphens, meaning the name cannot contain a dot (.) or a space. Although uppercase characters are permitted in an attribute name, the name is automatically converted to lowercase before being stored. A best practice is to only use lowercase letters in the name and avoid starting the name with a number. Attribute values can: be any inline content, and contain line breaks, but only if an explicit line continuation (+) is used. In Example 2, a custom attribute’s name and value are defined using an attribute entry. Example 2. Define a custom attribute using an attribute entry = Page Title :url-repo: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/docs-site Now, you can reference the attribute wherever needed throughout the page by entering its name inside a set of curly braces ({attribute-name}). You can see another example of a custom attribute being used to replace a complex URL in Create an attribute for a URL. Built-in and custom attributes can be unset, that is, turned off, with a leading or trailing bang symbol (!) added to its name in an attribute entry. = Page Title :!sectanchors: :table-caption!: Once unset, an attribute’s behavior and value are no longer available to the page. Attributes can be scoped to a whole site by declaring them in a site’s playbook file. You can apply attributes to a single component version by declaring them in a component descriptor file (i.e., antora.yml). Attributes which are hard set or hard unset in the playbook or component descriptor take precedence over attributes defined in a page. This precedence order can be inverted using the precedence modifier. Intrinsic attributes can never be modified and are thus considered read-only. See the precedence rules for site attributes and component version attributes for more information.","title":"Define and Modify Attributes","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"define-and-modify-attributes","url":"/antora/3.1/page/define-and-modify-attributes.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s an attribute entry?","hash":"attribute-entry","id":1},{"text":"Set a built-in attribute","hash":"set-attribute","id":2},{"text":"Assign a value to a built-in attribute","hash":"assign-a-value-to-a-built-in-attribute","id":3},{"text":"Define a custom attribute","hash":"custom-attribute","id":4},{"text":"Unset an attribute","hash":"unset-an-attribute","id":5},{"text":"Precedence rules","hash":"precedence-rules","id":6}]},"140":{"id":140,"text":"Examples are useful for storing source code, queries, configuration parameters, terminal output, logs, data sets, and other non-AsciiDoc files, that you reuse in one or more pages throughout your site. Changes you make to an example file will disseminate to all of the pages where you referenced the example the next time you build your site. Example files are usually non-AsciiDoc files. They’re stored in an examples directory. When saving a new example file, keep the following filename requirements and recommendations in mind: An example’s filename can’t contain spaces because the AsciiDoc include directive doesn’t accept values with spaces. Uppercase letters aren’t recommended in filenames. Some file systems aren’t case sensitive. Therefore, file conflicts could occur depending on the file system a writer is using. Save an example file with a valid file extension except when it’s common industry practice for that specific file type, such as Dockerfile, to not have an extension. Not using the correct file extension when saving an example file may limit your ability to apply some Antora extensions or upgrade to future capabilities. Unlike publishable resources, an example file without a file extension isn’t treated as a hidden file. Antora will load an example that doesn’t have a file extension into its content catalog and assign the example a resource ID for referencing. Antora doesn’t publish example files as individual site pages. An example must be referenced by an include directive from a page, or resource that’s eventually included in a page, for the example’s content to be published. Typically, content from an example file is inserted into source, listing, and literal blocks. Regardless of the component version an example file belongs to, it can be referenced by any page or partial in your site. An example is referenced using its resource ID and the AsciiDoc include directive. You can even select regions or lines from an example, instead of all of the example’s content, and insert only those regions or lines using the include directive’s tag, tags, or lines attributes. Examples shouldn’t be confused with the AsciiDoc example block, though content from an example file can be inserted into an example block using an include directive.","title":"Examples","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"examples","url":"/antora/3.1/page/examples.html","titles":[{"text":"Reusable, single source examples","hash":"reusable-single-source-examples","id":1},{"text":"Example filenames and file extensions","hash":"example-filenames-and-file-extensions","id":2},{"text":"Example file usage","hash":"example-file-usage","id":3}]},"141":{"id":141,"text":"You can insert an image into any page in your site, regardless of the module or component version to which the target image file belongs.

When the target image is stored at the root of the images family directory, the file coordinate is the target image’s filename and file extension. Remember, the file coordinate of the target image is always calculated from the root of the images family directory. Example 2. File coordinate in an image macro when the target image is stored at the root of an images directory image::target-image-filename.ext[optional attribute] Let’s use the files that belong to the component version colorado 5.2 as the basis for the example in this section. The component version’s source files are assigned to modules and families based on the set of standard directories listed in Example 3. Example 3. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 images (3) 📄 wilderness-map.jpg 📂 pages (4) 📄 ridge.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines subsequent files as images 4 Defines subsequent files as pages Using the two files that belong to the la-garita module, shown in Example 3 above, let’s insert the wilderness-map.jpg image into the ridge.adoc page. That means the source file wilderness-map.jpg is the target image and ridge.adoc is the current page. Example 4 shows a block image macro in the ridge.adoc page (current page) that references, the wilderness-map.jpg image (target image). When the target image and current page belong to the same module, only the file coordinate of the target image’s resource ID needs to be entered in the image macro. Example 4. ridge.adoc (current page) The trailhead is north of town. image::wilderness-map.jpg[] In Example 4, the file coordinate for the wilderness-map.jpg image is wilderness-map.jpg. Its file coordinate consists solely of its filename and file extension because wilderness-map.jpg is stored at the root of the images directory. If the target image is stored in a subdirectory of the images directory, its file coordinate must specify the images-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. See File coordinate with images-relative directory path for file coordinate examples when the target image is stored in a subdirectory. The images-relative directory path of the target image is required in its file coordinate when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the images directory. Example 5. File coordinate in an image macro when the target image is stored in a subdirectory of an images directory image::path/to/target-image-filename.ext[optional attribute] Let’s use the pages that belong to the component version shown in Example 6 as the basis for the examples in this section. Example 6. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 images (3) 📂 aerial (4) 📄 skyline.jpg 📂 pages (5) 📄 ridge.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines subsequent files as images 4 A subdirectory in images containing the source files of images 5 Defines subsequent files as pages Let’s reference skyline.jpg from ridge.adoc. As you can see in Example 6 above, the image and page belong to the la-garita module. In Example 7, an image macro in the ridge.adoc page (current page) references the skyline.jpg image (target image). Example 7. ridge.adoc (current page) = La Garita Ridgeline image::aerial/skyline.jpg[] As shown in Example 7, the file coordinate for skyline.jpg is aerial/skyline.jpg. The file coordinate for skyline.jpg consists of its images-relative directory path, filename, and file extension because it’s stored in the subdirectory aerial. In special circumstances where the images-relative directory path of the target image and the pages-relative directory path of the current page are parallel, the images-relative directory path of the file coordinate can be replaced with the relative path token, ./. When the target image and current page don’t belong to the same module, you must specify the target image’s module coordinate and file coordinate in the image macro. Example 8. Module and file coordinates assigned to an image macro image:module:target-image-filename.ext[optional attribute] (1) image:module:path/to/target-image-filename.ext[optional attribute] (2) 1 The image macro is assigned the module coordinate and file coordinate of the target image when the target image doesn’t belong to the same module as the current page. The target image’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when the target image is stored at the root of an images family directory. 2 If the target image is stored in a subdirectory of an images directory, the target image’s file coordinate must specify its images-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. Let’s use the files that belong to the component version shown in Example 9 as the basis for the examples in this section. Example 9. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 images (3) 📂 aerial (4) 📄 skyline.jpg 📂 pages (5) 📄 ridge.adoc 📄 willow-creek.adoc 📂 ROOT (6) 📂 images (7) 📄 peak.svg 📂 pages (8) 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines subsequent files as images 4 A subdirectory in images containing the source files of images 5 Defines subsequent files as pages 6 Defines the ROOT module 7 Defines subsequent files as images 8 Defines subsequent files as pages From the colorado 5.2 component version, shown in Example 9 above, let’s insert the peak.svg image into the willow-creek.adoc page. That means the source file peak.svg is the target image and willow-creek.adoc is the current page. Example 10 shows an inline image macro in willow-creek.adoc (current page) that references the image file peak.svg (target image). The module and file coordinates of the target image’s resource ID are assigned to the image macro. The willow-creek.adoc page belongs to the la-garita module. The peak.svg image belongs to the ROOT module. Example 10. Insert peak.svg (target image) into willow-creek.adoc (current page) The elevation is image:ROOT:peak.svg[] 10,067 ft (3,068 m). As shown in Example 10, the target image’s module coordinate is ROOT and its file coordinate is peak.svg. In Example 11, let’s embed the skyline.jpg image (target image) into ranges.adoc (current page). The skyline.jpg image belongs to the la-garita module and ranges.adoc belongs to the ROOT module. Example 11. Insert skyline.jpg (target image) into ranges.adoc (current page) image::la-garita:aerial/skyline.jpg[] As shown in Example 11, the target image’s module coordinate is la-garita and its file coordinate is aerial/skyline.jpg because it’s stored in the aerial subdirectory of the images family directory. When the target image and current page belong to different documentation components, you must specify, at a minimum, the target image’s component, module, and file coordinates in the image macro. You’ll almost always specify the version coordinate, too. Example 12. Version, component, module, and file coordinates assigned to an image macro image:version@component:module:target-image-filename.ext[optional attribute] (1) image:version@component:module:path/to/target-image-filename.ext[optional attribute] (2) image:component:module:file-coordinate-of-target-image.ext[optional attribute] (3) 1 The image macro is assigned the version, component, module, and file coordinates of the target image when the target image and current page don’t belong to the same component version. The target image’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when the target image is stored at the root of an images family directory. 2 If the target image is stored in a subdirectory of an images directory, the target image’s file coordinate must specify its images-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. 3 If the version coordinate isn’t specified, Antora uses the latest version of the target image’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target image and current page belong to different docs components. Let’s use the files that belong to the component versions colorado 5.2 (Example 13) and wyoming 1.0 (Example 14) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 13. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 images (3) 📄 peak.svg 📂 pages (4) 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent files as images 4 Defines subsequent source files as pages Example 14. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre (2) 📂 images (3) 📄 panorama.png 📂 pages (4) 📄 elevation.adoc 📄 wilderness-areas.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.0 2 Defines a module named sierra-madre 3 Defines subsequent files as images 4 Defines subsequent files as pages Using files from Example 13 and Example 14, let’s insert panorama.png (target image) into ranges.adoc (current page). The image panorama.png belongs to the sierra-madre module of wyoming 1.0. In Example 15, the resource ID assigned to the image macro specifies the version, component, module, and file coordinates of the target image because the target image belongs to the wyoming 1.0 component version whereas the current page belongs to colorado 5.2. Example 15. Insert panorama.png (target image) as a block image into ranges.adoc (current page) image::1.0@wyoming:sierra-madre:panorama.png[] As shown in Example 15, the target image’s version coordinate is 1.0, its component coordinate is wyoming, its module coordinate is sierra-madre, and its file coordinate is panorama.png. Now, in Example 16, let’s insert peak.svg (target image) into wilderness-areas.adoc (current page). The peak.svg image belongs to the component version colorado 5.2. The wilderness-areas.adoc page belongs to the component version wyoming 1.0. Example 16. wilderness-areas.adoc (current page) image:5.2@colorado::peak.svg[] Bridger Peak is in the Sierra Madre range. Notice in Example 16 that the module coordinate ROOT seems to be missing from the resource ID. When a component coordinate is specified in a resource ID, and the target image belongs to the ROOT module, the module coordinate ROOT doesn’t have to be explicitly specified. But you must still enter the colon (:) that would follow the module coordinate. You can see this : directly before the file coordinate peak.svg. This shorthand only works when a component coordinate is specified and the module coordinate of the target image is ROOT. In all other cases where the module coordinate is required, the name of the module must be specified. You may have noticed that the version coordinate is specified in both Example 15 and Example 16. If you don’t specify the version, Antora will complete the resource ID of the target image using the version coordinate of the target image’s latest component version at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target image and current page belong to different docs components! If a version isn’t specified in the resource ID, and the target image and current page belong to different documentation components, Antora uses the version coordinate of the latest version of the target image’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. Let’s use the files that belong to colorado 5.2 (Example 13 in the previous section), wyoming 1.0 (Example 14 in the previous section), and wyoming 1.5 (Example 17 below) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 17. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.5 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre 📂 images 📄 panorama.png 📂 pages 📄 elevation.adoc 📄 wilderness-areas.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.5 Let’s reference the panorama.png image (target image) from index.adoc (current page). index.adoc belongs to the colorado 5.2 component version . There are two files named panorama.png that belong to the wyoming component, sierra-madre module, and images family. One panorama.png belongs to version 1.0, the other panorama.png to version 1.5. Example 18 shows a block image macro referencing panorama.png (target image) from index.adoc (current page). Notice that the target image’s version coordinate isn’t specified. Example 18. index.adoc (current page) image::wyoming:sierra-madre:panorama.png[] When Antora runs, it will identify wyoming 1.5 as the latest version of the wyoming component according to its version sorting rules and latest version criteria. Because a version coordinate isn’t specified in Example 18, Antora will complete the resource ID assigned to the image macro using the version coordinate — 1.5 — of the latest wyoming component. This behavior of linking to the latest version only applies when the version coordinate is unspecified and the target image and current page belong to different components. If the version and component coordinates aren’t specified in the resource ID, Antora assumes the target image belongs to the same component version as the current page and uses the current page’s version and component coordinates to complete the target image’s resource ID. When the current page and target image belong to the same component, but the target image belongs to a different version of the component, you’ll specify the version, module (if it’s different than the current page’s module), and file coordinates. Example 19. current-page.adoc image:version@module:file-coordinate-of-target-image.ext[optional attribute] (1) image:version@file-coordinate-of-target-image.ext[optional attribute] (2) 1 The image macro is assigned the version, module, and file coordinates of the target image when the target image doesn’t belong to the same version and module as the current page. 2 The image macro is assigned the version and file coordinates of the target image when the target image doesn’t belong to the same version as the current page. Let’s use the files that belong to the component version colorado 5.2 (Example 20) and the component version colorado 6.0 (Example 21) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 20. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita 📂 images 📄 wilderness-map.jpg 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc ... 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 Example 21. Directories and files assigned to colorado 6.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 ridge.adoc 📄 willow-creek.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 6.0 Notice that the colorado 5.2 component version in Example 20 has the image wilderness-map.jpg. However, colorado 6.0, shown in Example 21, has no such image file. Let’s reference the image wilderness-map.jpg (target image), which belongs to colorado 5.2, from the ridge.adoc page (current page) that belongs to the colorado 6.0 component version. Both resources belong to the la-garita module. In Example 22, the image wilderness-map.jpg (target image) is embedded in the page ridge.adoc (current page). Example 22. ridge.adoc (current page) in colorado 6.0 image::5.2@wilderness-map.jpg[] As shown in Example 22, the target image’s version coordinate is 5.2 and its file coordinate is wilderness-map.jpg.","title":"Image Resource ID Examples","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"image-resource-id-examples","url":"/antora/3.1/page/image-resource-id-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"Use an image within a module","hash":"use-an-image-within-a-module","id":1},{"text":"File coordinate at images directory root","hash":"images-root","id":2},{"text":"File coordinate with images-relative directory path","hash":"relative-path","id":3},{"text":"Use an image from another module","hash":"modules","id":4},{"text":"Use an image from another docs component","hash":"component-versions","id":5},{"text":"Use the latest version of an image","hash":"latest-version","id":6},{"text":"Use an image from another version of its component","hash":"versions","id":7}]},"142":{"id":142,"text":"You can create a link from an image to a page, attachment, image, or element by assigning the xref attribute to an inline or block image macro. The xref element attribute can be set in the attribute list of block and inline image macros. The xref attribute is optional. It’s structured and behaves the same way regardless of whether you assign it to a block image macro or inline image macro. The xref attribute accepts the resource ID of a publishable resource—​a page, attachment, or image—​as a value. Example 1. Set the xref attribute and assign it a resource ID image::an-image.jpg[xref=version@component:module:family$file.ext] It also accepts the ID of an element that’s specified in the current page. The element ID must be prefixed with the hash symbol (#) when assigned to the xref attribute. Example 2. Set the xref attribute and assign is an element ID image::an-image.gif[xref=#fragment] When your site is published and a visitor selects the embedded image, they’ll be linked to the URL of the published resource or jump to the anchor in the current published page that corresponds to the specified element ID. The xref attribute in a named attribute. If you set positional attributes, such as alt text, width, or height, on the image macro, assign them in the attribute list before setting the xref or any other named attributes. Example 3. Optional positional and named attributes assigned to an image macro image:an-image.svg[The image alt text,xref=version@component:module:family$file.ext,title=\"A tooltip for the image\"] Positional and named element attributes are separated by commas in the attribute list of the image macros. To reference a page from an embedded image, set the xref attribute in the attribute list, followed by an equals sign (=), and then the resource ID of the target page. How many of the target page’s resource ID coordinates you need to specify depends on the component version and module of the target page in relation to the current page. Example 4. current-page.adoc image::console.svg[xref=modes.adoc] (1) 1 The resource ID assigned to xref only specifies the file coordinate of the page because, for this example, let’s assume the current page and target page belong to the same component version and module. The block image macro shown in Example 4 will embed the image console.svg into the current page and create a link from the image to the published URL of the target page. You can also append a fragment to the end of the page’s resource ID to link to an element within the page. In Example 5, a fragment that corresponds to the element ID protocols that’s set in the content of modes.adoc is appended to the end of the resource ID for modes.adoc. Example 5. current-page.adoc image::console.svg[xref=modes.adoc#protocols] You can also link to an element ID in the current page. To reference an attachment from an embedded image, set the xref attribute in the attribute list, followed by an equals sign (=), and then the resource ID of the target attachment. Make sure the family coordinate, attachment$, is specified in the value assigned to the xref attribute. Example 6 shows an inline image macro with three positional attributes set in the macro’s attribute list, followed by the named xref attribute. The xref attribute is assigned the resource ID of an attachment. Example 6. current-page.adoc Select the image:red-dot.jpg[Red circle,40,40,xref=telemetry:attachment$flight-patterns.pdf]. (1) (2) 1 Positional attributes are optional. If you do set one or more positional attributes on an image macro, assign them in the attribute list before setting xref or any other named attributes. In this example, the positional attributes alt, width, and height are set in the order accepted by the image macros. 2 The resource ID assigned to xref specifies the module, attachment$, and file coordinate of the target attachment because, for this example, let’s assume the target attachment belongs to a different module than the current page. The attachment$ coordinate is always required when the resource is an attachment. The inline image macro shown in Example 6 will embed the image red-dot.jpg into the current page and create a link from the image to the published URL of the target attachment. To reference an element in the current page, assign the ID of the element to the xref attribute. Prefix the element ID with the hash symbol (#) when you assign it to the xref attribute. Example 7 shows a block image macro with an xref attribute assigned an element ID that corresponds to an ID on the current page. Example 7. current-page.adoc image::panorama.png[xref=#elevation] (1) The range can be traversed by Cottonwood Pass, Independence Pass, or Hagerman Pass.

An AsciiDoc include directive inserts content from the source file of a page into another page. The include directive accepts the Antora resource ID of partials, examples, and pages as a value. Example 1 shows the structure of an include directive with the fully qualified resource ID of a page. By default, the include directive assumes the family coordinate is page$ when a family coordinate isn’t specified. Example 1. Include directive assigned the fully qualified resource ID of a page include::version@component:module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional attribute] An include directive consists of the directive’s prefix (include::), the resource ID of the target page, and a set of square brackets ([]). You can specify optional attributes within the square brackets as key-value pairs separated by commas. The target page is the source file of a page that’s being referenced by the current page. The target page is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an include directive in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the include directive that references the target page. When Antora runs, the source content from the target page is inserted into the current page at the location where the include directive is entered. The target page’s content is converted after it’s inserted into the current page. This means the current page’s component version, module, attributes, and other elements are applied to or may impact the content included from the target page. See Current page context and structure to learn more. Let’s break down the AsciiDoc include directive and resource ID coordinates you need to insert a target page into the current page. In your IDE or plain text editor, open the page where you want to include content from the target page. For this step and the subsequent steps, let’s assume you’ve opened the file ranges.adoc. Example 2. ranges.adoc (current page) There are three mountain passes in the Sawatch Range. The current page, ranges.adoc, belongs to the component version colorado 5.2 and module ROOT, shown in Example 3. Example 3. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 cottonwood-pass.adoc 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent files as pages In the current page, select the line where you want the page’s content to be inserted. At the beginning of the line, enter the name of the directive followed by two colons, include::. Example 4. ranges.adoc (current page) There are three mountain passes in the Sawatch Range. include:: Let’s reference the target page, cottonwood-pass.adoc, from the current page. Assign the resource ID of the target page to the include directive. Both cottonwood-pass.adoc and ranges.adoc belong to the same component version and module (see Example 3). Therefore, only the file coordinate of the target page needs to be specified. Example 5. ranges.adoc (current page) There are three mountain passes in the Sawatch Range. include::cottonwood-pass.adoc The file coordinate for the cottonwood-pass.adoc page is cottonwood-pass.adoc. The target page’s file coordinate consists solely of its filename and file extension because cottonwood-pass.adoc is stored at the root of the pages directory. You can specify the page$ family coordinate in the resource ID if you prefer, but it isn’t required when including a page into a page. The include directive assumes the family coordinate is page$ when it isn’t specified. Directly after the resource ID of the target page, complete the directive with a set of square brackets ([]). Example 6. ranges.adoc (current page) There are three mountain passes in the Sawatch Range. include::cottonwood-pass.adoc[] The brackets of the include directive can contain an optional list of attributes, such as lines, tag, or tags. The attributes are entered as key-value pairs separated by commas. See the AsciiDoc include directive documentation for full details about the lines, tag, and tags syntax. That’s it! You’ve created an include directive that will insert the target page into the current page. The structure of the target page’s file coordinate varies depending on whether the target page is stored at the root of the pages family directory, like in the preceding instructions, or in a subdirectory of the pages directory. Example 7. current-page.adoc include::target-page-filename.adoc[] (1) include::path/to/target-page-filename.adoc[] (2) include::./target-page-filename.adoc[] (3) 1 File coordinate of the target page when it’s stored at the root of the pages directory. 2 File coordinate of the target page when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the pages directory. 3 File coordinate of the target page when the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory of the pages directory. The following sections describe how to specify a file coordinate with a pages-relative directory path or relative path token. Also, you’ll need to specify additional resource ID coordinates when the target page and current page don’t belong to the same module or component version. The pages-relative directory path of the target page is required in its file coordinate when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the pages directory. Example 8. File coordinate when the target page is stored in a subdirectory of a pages directory include::path/to/target-page-filename.adoc[optional attribute] Let’s use the files that belong to the component version in Example 9 as the basis for the example in this section. Example 9. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 cottonwood-pass.adoc 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 📂 supplies (4) 📄 gear.adoc 📄 safety.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent files as pages 4 A subdirectory in pages containing the source files of pages Let’s reference safety.adoc from cottonwood-pass.adoc. As you can see in Example 9 above, the target page and current page belong to the ROOT module. In Example 10, an include directive in the cottonwood-pass.adoc page (current page) references the safety.adoc file (target page). Example 10. cottonwood-pass.adoc (current page) == Trip planning include::supplies/safety.adoc[] As shown in Example 10, the file coordinate for safety.adoc is supplies/safety.adoc.adoc. The file coordinate for safety.adoc consists of its pages-relative directory path, filename, and file extension because it’s stored in the subdirectory supplies while the current page, cottonwood-pass.adoc, is stored in the pages directory. If the current page and target page were stored in the same subdirectory, you could use the relative path token, ./, in place of the pages-relative directory path. If the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory within the pages directory, the pages-relative directory path of the target page’s file coordinate can be replaced with the relative path token, ./. Example 11. File coordinate in include directive when the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory include::./target-page-filename.adoc[] Let’s use the pages that belong to the component version shown in Example 12 as the basis for the examples in this section. Example 12. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 cottonwood-pass.adoc 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 📂 supplies (4) 📄 gear.adoc 📄 safety.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent files as pages 4 A subdirectory in pages containing the source files of pages Let’s reference gear.adoc from safety.adoc. Example 12 shows that both files are stored in the supplies subdirectory of the pages directory, and that both files belong to the ROOT module of the same component version. When the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory within the pages directory, the relative path token, ./, can be used to abbreviate the target page’s file coordinate. In Example 13, the include directive in the safety.adoc page (current page) references the gear.adoc page (target page). Example 13. safety.adoc (current page) include::./gear.adoc[] As shown in Example 13, the file coordinate for gear.adoc, when referenced from safety.adoc, is ./gear.adoc. Both pages are stored in the supplies subdirectory, therefore, the pages-relative directory path of the target page’s file coordinate is replaced with the ./ token. You may find that the include directive resolves the target page when the ./ token isn’t used in the file coordinate. However, we strongly recommend using the ./ token when referencing a target page that is stored in the same subdirectory as the current page. You can include a page from any module or component version into another page that belongs to your site by assigning the target page’s module coordinate or version, component, and module coordinates, respectively, to the include directive. Example 14. current-page.adoc include::module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[] (1) include::version@component:module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[] (2) include::component:module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[] (3) 1 Assign the module and file coordinates of the target page to the include directive when the target page and current page belong to the same component version but not the same module. 2 Assign the version, component, module, and file coordinates of the target page to the include directive when the target page and current page don’t belong to the same component version. 3 If the version coordinate isn’t specified, Antora uses the latest version of the target page’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target page and current page belong to different docs components. For example, to embed the content of cottonwood-pass.adoc (target page) into a page (current page) that belongs to a different module of the colorado 5.2 component version, specify the target page’s module coordinate in the include directive. Example 15. current-page.adoc include::ROOT:cottonwood-pass.adoc[] If the current page belongs to a different component version than cottonwood-pass.adoc (target page), specify the target page’s version, component, module, and file coordinates. Example 16. current-page.adoc include::5.2@colorado:ROOT:cottonwood-pass.adoc[] As shown in Example 16, the target page’s version coordinate is 5.2, its component coordinate is colorado, its module coordinate is ROOT, and its file coordinate is cottonwood-pass.adoc. An include directive is placed at the beginning of a new line. The content from the target page will be displayed as a standalone block when you enter an empty line above and below the include directive. You can attach content from the target page to a block in the current page by placing the include directive on a new line directly adjacent to the content to which it should be attached. Example 17. current-page.adoc A paragraph in the page. include::resource-id-of-target-page.adoc[tag=value] (1) A line of content. include::resource-id-of-target-page.adoc[] (2) Another line of content. 1 To display the included content as a standalone block, make sure there is an empty line before the include directive and after the include directive. 2 To attach the included content to a block in the current page, enter the include directive on a new line directly above, between, or below the content lines of the block.

If you aren’t familiar with the Antora resource ID and its coordinates, see: Resources and Resource IDs Resource ID Coordinates An AsciiDoc include directive inserts content from a partial’s source file into another partial or a page. The include directive accepts the Antora resource ID of partials, examples, and pages as a value. Although a partial is typically an AsciiDoc fragment, a partial can be any text document with no restriction on the file’s extension. If the partial is not AsciiDoc, you have to be sure you’re inserting into a place in the AsciiDoc document that accepts non-AsciiDoc content, such as a diagram block, a code block, or CSV table. If the partial is a code example, you’re encouraged to store it as an example rather than a partial since an example is a specialized form of a partial. This page focuses on partials which are AsciiDoc files. Example 1 shows the structure of an include directive with the fully qualified resource ID of a partial. Because the include directive is used to reference other resources, the partial$ family coordinate must be specified in the partial’s resource ID when it’s assigned to an include directive. Example 1. Include directive assigned the fully qualified resource ID of a partial include::version@component:module:partial$file-coordinate-of-target-partial.adoc[optional attribute] At a minimum, an include directive consists of the directive’s prefix (include::), the resource ID of the target partial, and a set of square brackets ([]). You can specify optional attributes within the square brackets as key-value pairs separated by commas. The target partial is the source file of a partial that’s being referenced by the current page. The target partial is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an include directive in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the include directive that references the target partial. When Antora runs, content from the target partial is inserted into the current page at the location where the include directive is entered. The target partial’s content is converted after it’s inserted into the current page. This means the current page’s component version, module, attributes, and other elements are applied to or may impact the content included from the target partial. See Current page context and structure to learn more. Let’s break down the AsciiDoc include directive and resource ID coordinates you need to insert a target partial into the current page. In your IDE or plain text editor, open the page where you want to insert the partial. For this step and the subsequent steps, let’s assume you’ve opened the file ranges.adoc. Example 2. ranges.adoc (current page) = Hike the Ranges == Terrain Above the treeline, the trail becomes a hard scramble. The current page, ranges.adoc, belongs to the component version colorado 5.2 and module ROOT, shown in Example 3. Example 3. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 📂 partials (4) 📄 treeline-warning.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent files as pages 4 Defines subsequent files as partials In the current page, select the line where you want the partial’s content to be inserted. At the beginning of the line, enter the name of the directive followed by two colons, include::. Example 4. ranges.adoc (current page) Above the treeline, the trail becomes a hard scramble. include:: Let’s reference the target partial, treeline-warning.adoc, from the current page. Assign the resource ID of the target partial to the include directive. Both treeline-warning.adoc and ranges.adoc belong to the same component version and module (see Example 3). Therefore, only the partial$ family coordinate and file coordinate of the target partial need to be specified. Example 5. ranges.adoc (current page) Above the treeline, the trail becomes a hard scramble. include::partial$treeline-warning.adoc The file coordinate for the treeline-warning.adoc partial is treeline-warning.adoc. The target partial’s file coordinate consists solely of its filename and file extension because treeline-warning.adoc is stored at the root of the partials directory. By default, the include directive assumes the family coordinate is page$ when the coordinate isn’t specified. If you forget to use the partial$ coordinate, Antora will report an error because it won’t be able to find the partial. Directly after the resource ID of the target partial, complete the directive with a set of square brackets ([]). Example 6. ranges.adoc (current page) Above the treeline, the trail becomes a hard scramble. include::partial$treeline-warning.adoc[] The brackets of the include directive can contain an optional list of attributes, such as lines, tag, or tags. Attributes are entered as key-value pairs separated by commas. See the AsciiDoc include directive documentation for full details about the lines, tag, and tags syntax. That’s it! You’ve created an include directive that will insert the target partial into the current page. The preceding instructions showed you how to insert a partial into a page under the most common scenario—​the target partial and current page belong to the same component version and module and the target partial is stored at the root of a partials folder. However, if the target partial is stored in a subdirectory of the partials directory, its file coordinate must specify the partials-relative directory path in addition to its filename and file extension. Example 7. current-page.adoc include::partial$target-partial-filename.adoc[] (1) include::partial$path/to/target-partial-filename.adoc[] (2) include::partial$./target-partial-filename.adoc[] (3) 1 File coordinate of the target partial when it’s stored at the root of the partials directory. 2 File coordinate of the target partial when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the partials directory. 3 File coordinate of the target partial when the target partial and current page are stored in subdirectories with parallel family-relative directory paths. This is an advanced use case. Also, you’ll need to specify additional resource ID coordinates when the target partial and current page don’t belong to the same module or component version. The following sections provide examples showing the various resource ID scenarios. The partials-relative directory path of the target partial is required in its file coordinate when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the partials directory. Example 8. File coordinate when the target partial is stored in a subdirectory of a partials directory include::partial$path/to/target-partial-filename.adoc[optional attribute] Let’s use the files that belong to the component version in Example 9 as the basis for the example in this section. Example 9. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 ridge.adoc 📂 partials (4) 📂 climate (5) 📄 gear-list.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines subsequent files as pages 4 Defines subsequent files as partials 5 A subdirectory in partials containing the source files of partials Let’s reference gear-list.adoc from ridge.adoc. As you can see in Example 9 above, the partial and page belong to the la-garita module. In Example 10, an include directive in the ridge.adoc page (current page) references the gear-list.adoc file (target partial). Example 10. ridge.adoc (current page) == Plan your hike include::partial$climate/gear-list.adoc[] As shown in Example 10, the family coordinate is partial$ and the file coordinate for gear-list.adoc is climate/gear-list.adoc. The file coordinate for gear-list.adoc consists of its partials-relative directory path, filename, and file extension because it’s stored in the subdirectory climate. In special circumstances where the partials-relative directory path of the target partial and the pages-relative directory path of the current page are parallel, the partials-relative directory path can be replaced with the relative path token, ./. When the target partial and the current page don’t belong to the same module, you must specify the target partial’s module, family, and file coordinates in the include directive. Example 11. Module, family, and file coordinates assigned to an include directive include::module:partial$target-partial-filename.adoc[optional attribute] (1) include::module:partial$path/to/target-partial-filename.adoc[optional attribute] (2) 1 Assign the module, partial$, and file coordinates of the target partial to the include directive when the target partial and current page belong to the same component version but not the same module. The target partial’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when it’s stored at the root of a partials family directory. 2 If the target partial is stored in a subdirectory of a partials directory, the target partial’s file coordinate must specify its partials-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. Let’s use the files that belong to the component version shown in Example 12 as the basis for the example in this section. Example 12. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 ridge.adoc 📂 ROOT (4) 📂 partials (5) 📄 treeline-warning.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines subsequent files as pages 4 Defines a module named ROOT 5 Defines subsequent files as partials Let’s insert the treeline-warning.adoc partial into the ridge.adoc page. That means the source file treeline-warning.adoc is the target partial and ridge.adoc is the current page. As shown in Example 12 above, the ridge.adoc page belongs to the la-garita module, and the treeline-warning.adoc partial belongs to the ROOT module. Example 13 shows an include directive in ridge.adoc that references the partial treeline-warning.adoc. The module, partial$, and file coordinates of the target partial are assigned to the include directive. Example 13. ridge.adoc (current page) include::ROOT:partial$treeline-warning.adoc[] As shown in Example 13, the target partial’s module coordinate is ROOT, its family coordinate is partial$, and its file coordinate is treeline-warning.adoc. When the target partial and current page don’t belong to the same documentation component, specify the partial’s version, component, module, family, and file coordinates in the resource ID assigned to the include directive. Example 14. Version, component, module, family, and file coordinates assigned to an include directive include::version@component:module:partial$target-partial-filename.adoc[] (1) include::version@component:module:partial$path/to/target-partial-filename.adoc[] (2) include::component:module:partial$file-coordinate-of-target-partial.adoc[] (3) 1 Assign the version, component, module, family, and file coordinates of the target partial to the include directive when the target partial and current page don’t belong to the same component version. The target partial’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when the target partial is stored at the root of a partials family directory. 2 If the target partial is stored in a subdirectory of a partials directory, the target partial’s file coordinate must specify its partials-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. 3 If the version coordinate isn’t specified, Antora uses the latest version of the target partial’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target partial and current page belong to different docs components. Let’s use the files that belong to the component versions colorado 5.2 (Example 15) and wyoming 1.0 (Example 16) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 15. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 index.adoc 📂 partials (4) 📄 treeline-warning.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent source files as pages 4 Defines subsequent source files as partials Example 16. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 elevation.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.0 2 Defines a module named sierra-madre 3 Defines subsequent files as pages Using files from Example 15 and Example 16, let’s reference treeline-warning.adoc (target partial) from elevation.adoc (current page). The treeline-warning.adoc partial belongs to the component version colorado 5.2. The elevation.adoc page belongs to the component version wyoming 1.0. The include directive in Example 17 will embed the content of the treeline-warning.adoc partial into the elevation.adoc page. Example 17. elevation.adoc (current page) include::5.2@colorado:ROOT:partial$treeline-warning.adoc[] As shown in Example 17, the target partial’s version coordinate is 5.2, its component coordinate is colorado, its module coordinate is ROOT, its family coordinate is partial$, and its file coordinate is treeline-warning.adoc. You could also specify the resource ID for treeline-warning.adoc as 5.2@colorado::partial$treeline-warning.adoc (notice the module coordinate ROOT seems to be missing). When the target partial’s component coordinate is specified, and the target partial belongs to the ROOT module, the module coordinate ROOT doesn’t have to be explicitly specified. However, you must still enter the colon (:) that would follow the module coordinate. This shorthand only works when a component coordinate is specified and the module coordinate of the target partial is ROOT. This behavior only applies when the target partial and current page belong to different docs components! If a version isn’t specified in the resource ID assigned to an include directive, and the target partial and current page don’t belong to the same component, Antora uses the version coordinate of the latest version of the target partial’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. Let’s use the files that belong to the component versions colorado 5.2 (Example 18), wyoming 1.0 (Example 19), and wyoming 1.5 (Example 20) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 18. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita 📂 pages 📄 willow-creek.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 Example 19. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre 📂 pages 📄 elevation.adoc 📂 partials 📄 bears.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.0 Example 20. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.5 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre 📂 pages 📄 elevation.adoc 📂 partials 📄 bears.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.5 Let’s reference the bears.adoc partial (target partial) from the willow-creek.adoc page (current page). willow-creek.adoc belongs to component version colorado 5.2. There are two files named bears.adoc that belong to the wyoming component, sierra-madre module, and partials family. One bears.adoc belongs to version 1.0, the other bears.adoc to version 1.5. Example 21 shows an include directive referencing bears.adoc (target partial) from willow-creek.adoc (current page). Notice that the target partial’s version coordinate isn’t specified. Example 21. willow-creek.adoc (current page) include::wyoming:sierra-madre:partial$bears.adoc[] When Antora runs, it will identify wyoming 1.5 as the latest version of the wyoming component according to its version sorting rules and latest version criteria. Because a version coordinate isn’t specified in Example 21, Antora will complete the resource ID assigned to the include directive using the version coordinate — 1.5 — from the latest wyoming component. This behavior of linking to the latest version only applies when the version coordinate is unspecified and the target partial and current page belong to different components. If the version and component coordinates aren’t specified in the resource ID, Antora assumes the target partial belongs to the same component version as the current page and uses the current page’s version and component coordinates to complete the target partial’s resource ID. An include directive is placed at the beginning of a new line. The content from the target partial will be displayed as a standalone block when you enter an empty line above and below the include directive. You can attach content from the target partial to a block in the current page by placing the include directive on a new line directly adjacent to the content to which it should be attached. Example 22. current-page.adoc A paragraph in the page. include::partial$cli-options.adoc[tag=compass] (1) A line of content. include::partial$addendum.adoc[] (2) Another line of content. 1 To display the included content as a standalone block, make sure there is an empty line above the include directive and after the include directive. 2 To attach the included content to a block in the current page, enter the include directive on a new line directly above, between, or below the content lines of the block. If you use diagrams in your pages that are generated from source, you may want to store the diagram’s source in a separate file. It’s up to you whether to store that source as an example or partial. Since the source is not a code example, a partial seems like the more logical place. Create a folder under the partials directory and name it diagrams. Then, store the source of your diagram in that folder. Let’s assume the file is named partials/diagrams/my-schema.puml. You can now include that source into your page as follows: Example 23. Include the source of a diagram [plantuml,my-schema,svg] .... include::partial$diagrams/my-schema.puml[] .... You can refer to diagram sources in other modules, versions, or components, just like with other partials.

If you aren’t familiar with the Antora resource ID and its coordinates, see: Resources and Resource IDs Resource ID Coordinates An AsciiDoc include directive inserts content from an example’s source file into a partial or a page. The include directive accepts the Antora resource ID of examples, partials, and pages as a value. Example 1 shows the structure of an include directive with the fully qualified resource ID of an example. Because the include directive is used to reference other resources, the example$ family coordinate must be specified in the example’s resource ID when it’s assigned to an include directive. Example 1. Include directive assigned the fully qualified resource ID of an example include::version@component:module:example$file-coordinate-of-target-example.ext[optional attribute] An include directive consists of the directive’s prefix (include::), the resource ID of the target example, and a set of square brackets ([]). You can specify optional attributes within the square brackets as key-value pairs separated by commas. The target example is the source file of an example that’s being referenced by the current page. The target example is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an include directive in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the include directive that references the target example. When Antora runs, content from the target example is inserted into the current page at the location where the include directive is entered.

This means the current page’s component version, module, attributes, and other elements are applied to or may impact the content included from the target example. Let’s break down the AsciiDoc include directive and resource ID coordinates you need to insert a target example into the current page. In your IDE or plain text editor, open the page where you want to insert the example. For this step and the subsequent steps, let’s assume you’ve opened the file phases.adoc. Example files are often inserted into source blocks. Example 2 shows a source block with a title and an assigned language set up in the current page. Example 2. phases.adoc (current page) .First test phase [,js] ---- ---- The current page, phases.adoc, belongs to the component version mapper 8.0 and module testing, shown in Example 3. Example 3.

Example 4. phases.adoc (current page) .First test phase [,js] ---- include:: ---- Let’s reference the target example, timer.js, from the current page. Assign the resource ID of the target example to the include directive. Both timer.js and phases.adoc belong to the same component version and module (see Example 3). Therefore, only the example$ family coordinate and file coordinate of the target example need to be specified. Example 5. phases.adoc (current page) .First test phase [,js] ---- include::example$timer.js ---- The file coordinate for the timer.js example is timer.js. The target example’s file coordinate consists solely of its filename and file extension because timer.js is stored at the root of the examples directory.

However, if the target example is stored in a subdirectory of the examples directory, its file coordinate must specify the examples-relative directory path in addition to its filename and file extension. Example 7. current-page.adoc include::example$target-example-filename.ext[] (1) include::example$path/to/target-example-filename.ext[] (2) include::example$./target-example-filename.ext[] (3) 1 File coordinate of the target example when it’s stored at the root of the examples directory. 2 File coordinate of the target example when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the examples directory. 3 File coordinate of the target example when the target example and current page are stored in subdirectories with parallel family-relative directory paths. This is an advanced use case. Also, you’ll need to specify additional resource ID coordinates when the target example and current page don’t belong to the same module or component version. The following sections provide examples showing the various resource ID scenarios.

File coordinate when the target example is stored in a subdirectory of an examples directory include::example$path/to/target-example-filename.ext[optional attribute] Let’s use the files that belong to the component version in Example 9 as the basis for the example in this section.

As you can see in Example 9 above, the example and page belong to the ROOT module. In Example 10, an include directive in the interface-loader.adoc page (current page) references the job.yml file (target example). Example 10. interface-loader.adoc (current page) [,yaml] ---- include::example$providers/job.yml[] ---- As shown in Example 10, the family coordinate is example$ and the file coordinate for job.yml is providers/job.yml. The file coordinate for job.yml consists of its examples-relative directory path, filename, and file extension because it’s stored in the subdirectory providers. In special circumstances where the examples-relative directory path of the target example and the pages-relative directory path of the current page are parallel, the examples-relative directory path can be replaced with the relative path token, ./. When the target example and the current page don’t belong to the same module, you must specify the target example’s module, family, and file coordinates in the include directive. Example 11. Module, family, and file coordinates assigned to an include directive include::module:example$target-example-filename.ext[optional attribute] (1) include::module:example$path/to/target-example-filename.ext[optional attribute] (2) 1 Assign the module, example$, and file coordinates of the target example to the include directive when the target example and current page belong to the same component version but not the same module. The target example’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when it’s stored at the root of a examples family directory. 2 If the target example is stored in a subdirectory of a examples directory, the target example’s file coordinate must specify its examples-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. Let’s use the files that belong to the component version shown in Example 12 as the basis for the example in this section. Example 12.

That means the source file warm-up.js is the target example and index.adoc is the current page. As shown in Example 12 above, the index.adoc page belongs to the testing module, and the warm-up.js example belongs to the ROOT module. Example 13 shows an include directive in index.adoc that references the example warm-up.js. The module, example$, and file coordinates of the target example are assigned to the include directive. Example 13. index.adoc (current page) [,js] ---- include::ROOT:example$warm-up.js[] ---- As shown in Example 13, the target example’s module coordinate is ROOT, its family coordinate is example$, and its file coordinate is warm-up.js. When the target example and current page don’t belong to the same documentation component, specify the example’s version, component, module, family, and file coordinates in the resource ID assigned to the include directive. Example 14. Version, component, module, family, and file coordinates assigned to an include directive include::version@component:module:example$target-example-filename.ext[] (1) include::version@component:module:example$path/to/target-example-filename.ext[] (2) include::component:module:example$file-coordinate-of-target-example.ext[] (3) 1 Assign the version, component, module, family, and file coordinates of the target example to the include directive when the target example and current page don’t belong to the same component version. The target example’s file coordinate is its filename and file extension when the target example is stored at the root of a examples family directory. 2 If the target example is stored in a subdirectory of a examples directory, the target example’s file coordinate must specify its examples-relative directory path, filename, and file extension. 3 If the version coordinate isn’t specified, Antora uses the latest version of the target example’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target example and current page belong to different docs components. Let’s use the files that belong to the component versions mapper 8.0 (Example 15) and grid-twist 2.5 (Example 16) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 15.

The warm-up.js example belongs to the component version mapper 8.0. The interface-loader.adoc page belongs to the component version grid-twist 2.5. The include directive in Example 17 will embed the content of the warm-up.js example into the interface-loader.adoc page. Example 17. interface-loader.adoc (current page) [,js] ---- include::8.0@mapper:ROOT:example$warm-up.js[] ---- As shown in Example 17, the target example’s version coordinate is 8.0, its component coordinate is mapper, its module coordinate is ROOT, its family coordinate is example$, and its file coordinate is warm-up.js. You could also specify the resource ID for warm-up.js as 8.0@mapper::example$warm-up.js (notice the module coordinate ROOT seems to be missing). When the target example’s component coordinate is specified, and the target example belongs to the ROOT module, the module coordinate ROOT doesn’t have to be explicitly specified. However, you must still enter the colon (:) that would follow the module coordinate. This shorthand only works when a component coordinate is specified and the module coordinate of the target example is ROOT. This behavior only applies when the target example and current page belong to different docs components! If a version isn’t specified in the resource ID assigned to an include directive, and the target example and current page don’t belong to the same component, Antora uses the version coordinate of the latest version of the target example’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. Let’s use the files that belong to the component versions mapper 8.0 (Example 18), mapper 8.1 (Example 19), and grid-twist 2.5 (Example 20) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 18. Directories and files assigned to mapper 8.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 examples (3) 📄 warm-up.js 📂 testing (4) 📂 examples (5) 📄 timer.js 📂 pages (6) 📄 index.adoc 📄 phases.adoc 1 Defines the component version as mapper 8.0 Example 19.

There are two files named timer.js that belong to the mapper component, testing module, and examples family. One timer.js belongs to version 8.0, the other timer.js to version 8.1. Example 21 shows an include directive referencing timer.js (target example) from interface-loader.adoc (current page). Notice that the target example’s version coordinate isn’t specified. Example 21. interface-loader.adoc (current page) [,js] ---- include::mapper:testing:example$timer.js[] ---- When Antora runs, it will identify mapper 8.1 as the latest version of the mapper component according to its version sorting rules and latest version criteria. Because a version coordinate isn’t specified in Example 21, Antora will complete the resource ID assigned to the include directive using the version coordinate — 8.1 — from the latest mapper component. This behavior of linking to the latest version only applies when the version coordinate is unspecified and the target example and current page belong to different components. If the version and component coordinates aren’t specified in the resource ID, Antora assumes the target example belongs to the same component version as the current page and uses the current page’s version and component coordinates to complete the target example’s resource ID.

How to insert an inline image using its resource ID. An AsciiDoc inline image macro is used to embed the source file of an image into a partial or page. The inline image macro accepts the Antora resource ID of PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image files as a value. When Antora runs, the image file referenced by the inline image macro is embedded in the flow of another element, such as a sidebar block, and displayed in the published page. For example, this is an SVG image that’s embedded in this paragraph using the inline image macro. Example 1 shows the structure of an inline image macro. Example 1. Inline image macro This sentence contains an inline image:resource-id-of-target-image.ext[optional attribute,optional attribute] image. (1) 1 An inline image is entered into the flow of the content. It’s designated by a single colon (:) after the macro name. At a minimum, an inline image macro consists of the macro’s prefix (image:), the resource ID of the target image, and a set of square brackets ([]). The target image is the image source file that’s being referenced by the current page. The target image is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an inline or block image macro in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the image macro that references the target image. Each part of the inline image macro shown in Example 1 is described in more detail below. image: An inline image macro begins with the macro’s name, image, followed by a single colon (:). resource ID of target image The image macro accepts the resource ID of an image source file as its value. The value is entered directly after the colon that follows the macro’s name (image:). How many of the target image’s resource ID coordinates you need to specify depends on the component version and module of the target image in relation to the current page. When referencing an image from an image macro, you don’t need to include the image$ family coordinate in the target image’s resource ID. It’s applied automatically at runtime. [optional attribute,optional attribute] The inline image macro is completed with a set of square brackets ([]) at the end of the target image’s resource ID. You can leave the brackets empty, or assign one or more optional attributes as a comma-separated list inside the square brackets. The next section, Embed an inline image, explains how to set up an inline image macro step-by-step. Let’s break down the inline image macro and resource ID coordinates you need to insert an image (the target image) into a page (the current page) using the inline image macro. In your IDE or text editor, open the page where you want to insert an image. For this exercise, we’ve opened the file satellites.adoc. satellites.adoc is the current page. In satellites.adoc, let’s embed the inline image blue-dot.svg. Select the place in the content flow of the current page where you want the target image to be displayed. Enter the macro’s name followed by one colon (image:). Example 2. satellites.adoc (current page) Look for the image: Enter the resource ID of the target image file directly after the colon. In this example, both blue-dot.svg and satellites.adoc belong to the same component version and module and the target image is stored at the root of the images family directory. Therefore, only the filename and extension of blue-dot.svg needs to be assigned as the value of the inline image macro. Example 3. satellites.adoc (current page) Look for the image:blue-dot.svg Notice that the resource ID for blue-dot.svg doesn’t include its family coordinate. Antora automatically applies the image$ family coordinate to a resource ID assigned to an image macro. Directly after the resource ID of the target image, enter an opening square bracket ([) and then a closing square bracket (]). Example 4. satellites.adoc (current page) Look for the image:blue-dot.svg[] We didn’t apply any optional attributes to the inline image macro in this example; however, you can specify one or more attributes as a comma-separated list inside the square brackets. Press the SPACE bar once after the last square bracket (]) to insert a space after the macro, then continue entering your content. Example 5. satellites.adoc (current page) Look for the image:blue-dot.svg[] on the console. That’s it! You’ve finished inserting the target image (blue-dot.svg) into the current page (satellites.adoc) using the AsciiDoc inline image macro.

We refer to these as intrinsic attributes. Antora uses these attributes to propagate information about the site and current page to the AsciiDoc content, extensions, and UI templates. Unlike other built-in attributes, such as page-aliases, intrinsic attributes are meant to be a conduit to pass information from Antora to the page. Therefore, intrinsic attributes are intended to be read-only and should not be reassigned. These attributes are defined at the time the page or navigation file is loaded (i.e., parsed). They are not yet assigned when the attributes in the component descriptor are resolved, and are thus not visible to the component descriptor. Intrinsic environment attributes communicate to the document (or document extension) that the document is being processed by Antora. These attributes are set on every page in the site. env=site env-site site-gen=antora site-gen-antora You might use these attributes in an preprocessor conditional to include or exclude content based on whether the document is being process by Antora. For example: ifndef::site-gen-antora[] include::local-preview-settings.adoc[] endif::[] You can define additional environment attributes in the playbook. Antora sets various attributes to configure the AsciiDoc processor. attribute-missing=warn !data-uri icons=font sectanchors source-highlighter=highlight.js These attributes are intended to be reasonable defaults. Unlike other intrinsic attributes, they can be reconfigured using the CLI or playbook. They can also be redefined in such a way that they can be overridden by the component descriptor or page. The only syntax highlighter that Antora currently supports for source blocks is highlight.js. Therefore, it doesn’t make sense to change the source-highlighter attribute to any other value. If you’d like to disable syntax highlighting on source blocks, you can disable this attribute. Antora also passes general site information using attributes. site-title site-url The values of these attributes match the values defined in the playbook. Antora passes various information about the current page through page attributes. These attributes are reassigned for each page as well as each navigation file.

The value of these page attributes can be accessed in the AsciiDoc content using the attribute reference syntax (e.g., {page-component-name}) or via the page UI model using a template variable (e.g., page.attributes.component-name). Example 1. Reference the current page’s module name, component title, and version This page belongs to the *{page-module}* module in the *{page-component-title} {page-component-version}* component version. The attribute references in the above example output the data (shown below) for the current page, that is, the page you’re reading right now. This page belongs to the page module in the Antora 3.1 component version. Since these are page attributes, they are promoted to the page.attributes map in the page UI model with all other page attributes. They can be accessed in a UI template using a property expression (e.g., page.attributes.component-name).

This page attribute is useful when you delete a page, rename a page’s file, or move a page to a different module or component. Using the page-aliases attribute, a page can claim the identity of one or more other pages. Antora will then redirect the URLs for those pages to the page in which the aliases are defined. Page aliases are designed to address page renames or moves, particularly within a component version. They are not a general-purpose URL router. Although they can be used to create redirects across components or component versions, you need to use this feature with care or else it can become quite noisy and thus confusing. If you remove a large number of pages, such as if you remove or rename a component or component version, and you want to preserve the existing URLs, you should not attempt to do so using page aliases. Page aliases were not designed to provide bulk URL redirects. Instead, we strongly recommended that you use the router provided by your web server or host when you remove or rename a component or component version. You can do so either using a separate step during publishing or by using an Antora extension. The page-aliases attribute is set in the page header of a target page using an attribute entry. The target page refers to the page you’re redirecting a source page to. The source page refers to the deleted, renamed, or moved page that you’re redirecting from (i.e., the page to claim). A source page’s resource ID—​its resource ID before it was deleted, renamed, or moved—​is assigned to the page-aliases attribute in a target page. Multiple resource IDs can be assigned to the attribute in a comma-separated list. Example 1. Header of target page = Title of Target Page :page-aliases: source-page-filename.adoc, version@component:module:source-page-filename.adoc You can split this list across multiple lines using a line continuation (a space followed by a backslash at the end of the line): Example 2. Page aliases split across multiple lines = Title of Target Page :page-aliases: source-page-filename.adoc, \\ version@component:module:source-page-filename.adoc Antora calculates the URL for a source page’s resource ID and generates redirect information so that the source page URL redirects to the target page URL. Any coordinates, such as version or component, that aren’t specified in a resource ID assigned to page-aliases are interpolated from the target page’s coordinates. The generated output format of the redirect information is determined by your chosen redirect facility. A resource ID assigned to a page-aliases attribute can be used in an xref. Therefore, if you delete, rename, or move a page, you don’t need to update any references to it in your source files. The page-aliases attribute can only be applied to pages. Partials, examples, images, and attachments can’t be aliased. While a resource ID assigned to page-aliases works in xrefs, the page version selector in the reference UI does not connect previous versions of the source page to the target page. If you change a source page’s filename from old-name.adoc to new-name.adoc, assign the file’s former resource ID to page-aliases in its header. Example 3. new-name.adoc = Title of Target Page :page-aliases: old-name.adoc This will result in https://base-url.com/component/version/module/old-name.html being redirected to https://base-url.com/component/version/module/new-name.html. The version, component, and module coordinates that weren’t specified in the old-name.adoc resource ID are interpolated from the target page’s coordinates. Alternatively, if you assigned indexify to the html-extension-style key in your playbook, https://base-url.com/component/version/module/old-name/ will redirect to https://base-url.com/component/version/module/new-name/ . When a page is moved from one module to another module in the same component, the aliased resource ID needs to contain the source page’s former module coordinate. In Example 4, the page source-1.adoc has moved from module-1 to module-z. Both module-1 and module-z are modules in version 5.0 of component-1. Example 4. source-1.adoc = Title of Target Page :page-aliases: module-1:source-1.adoc (1) 1 Specify the former module coordinate in addition to the file coordinate when moving a page to another module. Now, Antora will redirect the URL https://base-url.com/component-1/5.0/module-1/source-1.html to the URL https://base-url.com/component-1/5.0/module-z/source-1.html. When a page is moved from one component to another component, assign the source page’s fully qualified former resource ID to page-aliases. In Example 5, the page source-w.adoc has moved from version 1.4 of component-8, module-u to version 3.0 of component-delta, ROOT. Example 5. source-w.adoc = Title of Target Page :page-aliases: 1.4@component-8:module-u:source-w.adoc This will result in the URL https://base-url.com/component-8/1.4/module-u/source-w.html being redirected to https://base-url.com/component-delta/3.0/source-w.html. Sometimes you just need to delete a page. Before redirecting the deleted page’s URL to another page, consider the following: Is there a potential target page that would help the visitors who previously used the information on the deleted page? For instance, the deleted page described feature A, but feature A has been deprecated; users of feature A should now migrate to feature B. Is the deleted page a high traffic page? If so, is there a relevant page that would definitely assist the people looking for the deleted page? You shouldn’t create a redirect to a target page that doesn’t have much in common with the deleted page, as this often frustrates visitors. If it’s appropriate to redirect the deleted page’s URL to another page, assign the deleted page’s ID to the page-aliases attribute, making sure to specify the necessary coordinates. Example 6. Target page = Title of Target Page :page-aliases: source-page-filename.adoc It creates a bad user experience (and is a bad SEO practice), to redirect deleted pages to the site’s home page or a project’s start page. This policy confuses visitors because they may not realize the page they’re looking for no longer exists. In cases where there isn’t a highly relevant target page to redirect the deleted page to, it’s better to direct visitors to a custom 404 page.","title":"Set Up URL Redirects with page-aliases","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"page-aliases","url":"/antora/3.1/page/page-aliases.html","titles":[{"text":"Page aliases and bulk URL redirects","hash":"page-aliases-and-bulk-url-redirects","id":1},{"text":"page-aliases attribute","hash":"page-aliases-attribute","id":2},{"text":"Page alias restrictions","hash":"page-alias-restrictions","id":3},{"text":"Create a redirect for a renamed page","hash":"create-a-redirect-for-a-renamed-page","id":4},{"text":"Create a redirect for a moved page","hash":"create-a-redirect-for-a-moved-page","id":5},{"text":"Create a redirect for a deleted page","hash":"create-a-redirect-for-a-deleted-page","id":6}]},"152":{"id":152,"text":"Certain AsciiDoc document attributes provide metadata to the Antora page (for use in the UI template) or control how Antora processes the page. We refer to these as page attributes. There are three types of page attributes: custom, predefined, and intrinsic. This page explains the purpose of each type of page attribute, how they’re defined, and how they can be accessed from the UI template using the UI model. Page attributes are all about providing metadata, whether that metadata is for Antora itself, for the UI template, for the user, or for a search index. By defining page attributes, you can store additional information about the page, which can then be accessed and used throughout the site. A page attribute is defined just like any other AsciiDoc document attribute, typically using an attribute entry in the document header. Where a page attribute differs is that the name of the attribute must begin with page- (e.g., page-category). The presence of the page- prefix allows Antora to identify it as a page attribute. If you’re wondering whether you need to add the page- prefix, ask yourself if you need to access the attribute from the UI template. If the answer is yes, then you need the prefix. Otherwise, the prefix is not required. Here’s an example of page that defines two page attributes: = Page Title :page-category: DevOps :page-edition: Enterprise Main content. The page- prefix is meant to provide a hint to both Antora and the author as to which attributes comprise the metadata for the page. By standardizing on the page- prefix, Antora is able to isolate page attributes from the numerous built-in and intrinsic attributes in AsciiDoc or defined by the AsciiDoc processor. The prefix also isolates the page attributes from internal attributes used to store reusable content within the page or site (aka custom content attributes). To define a page attribute, you add an attribute entry to the page header and start the name with page-. It’s important to define the attribute entry in the header. Otherwise, the page attribute will not be found. Here’s an example of an attribute entry that defines a page attribute: = Page Title :page-name-goes-here: value goes here The name of this page attribute is name-goes-here (the page- prefix plus the custom name, name-goes-here). Its value is value goes here. The name of the page attribute must adhere to the naming rules for a document attribute. The value can be left blank or it can be a string value. If the value is not blank, it must be offset from the closing colon (:) by at least one space. Since page attributes are just special AsciiDoc document attributes, they can also be defined site-wide in the Antora playbook or per component version in the component version descriptor. If you want to make information in an existing document attribute available as a page attribute, you must promote that attribute to a page attribute. You can promote a document attribute to a page attribute using an attribute reference. For example, let’s say you have the attribute product-name defined on the page or site. You can promote it to a page attribute using the following attribute entry: = Page Title :product-name: Name of My Product :page-product-name: {product-name} The attribute reference is resolved immediately, so the page attribute named page-product-name now shares the same value as the document attribute named product-name. Some page attributes receive special treatment in Antora. These page attributes have reserved names, but accept user-defined values for communicating information about the page to Antora. Examples include page-aliases, page-layout, and page-partial. The page-aliases attribute allows you to configure alternate resource IDs for the current page. For example, to claim the old name of a page, you’d use: = Page Title :page-aliases: old-page-name.adoc Unlike custom page attributes, the page-aliases attribute requires the value to conform to a specific syntax (i.e., a comma-separated list of resource IDs). See page aliases to learn about the page-aliases attribute and how it can be used to preserve references to a renamed, moved, or deleted page. The page-layout attribute allows you to specify which UI template to apply to the current page. For example, to apply the home layout to the current page, you’d use: = Home Page :page-layout: home See page layout to learn about the page-layout attribute and how it can be used to define which UI layout is applied to a page. Additional predefined page attributes may be added in the future to allow similar kinds of functionality to be configured. One of the primary roles of a page attribute is to pass metadata about the page to the UI template via the UI model. The UI template can then use the information provided by the page attributes in a variety of ways, from populating metadata in the published page (i.e, the HTML) to toggling or configuring behavior in the UI. Let’s look at an example. The default UI allows you do configure the depth of the sidebar TOC using the page attribute named toclevels (i.e., page-toclevels when defined). You could set this attribute globally in your playbook (or component descriptor). asciidoc: attributes: page-toclevels: 3@ The trailing @ is added so the attribute can still can be overridden in the header of a page. For example: = Page Title :page-toclevels: 2 Page attributes are accessible in the UI model via the page.attributes property. The value of this property is a map of attributes. To access the value of the page-toclevels attribute in a UI template, you’d use: {{page.attributes.toclevels}} So where’s the page- prefix gone? When a page attribute is promoted to the UI model, the page- prefix is dropped from its name. That’s why we often refer to the page attribute using its short name (e.g., toclevels). The page- prefix acts as a namespace to identify the attribute as a page attribute. Thus, a page attribute named page-toclevels becomes toclevels in the UI model (e.g., page.attributes.toclevels). Let’s look at another example that shows how the default UI uses a page attribute to control pagination. You’ll often set this attribute globally in your playbook or component descriptor. This time, however, we hard set the attribute so it cannot be turned off by a page. asciidoc: attributes: page-pagination: '' Now, in the footer-scripts.hbs partial template, we can check whether this attribute is set and include the pagination controls if it is. {{#unless (eq page.attributes.pagination undefined)}} ... {{/unless}} Notice we check whether the value is not equal to undefined rather than checking if it truthy. That’s because an empty value in JavaScript is falsy, so we have to make the assertion more specific. Inside the clause, the template can check whether the attribute has the value next or prev, implying the opposite direction should be turned off. The page- prefix on the attribute name is what hoists it to the UI model. All other document attributes are still accessible from the UI model, just not as easily. Here’s an example of how to reference a non-page attribute from the UI model: {{#with (resolvePage page.relativeSrcPath model=false)}} {{./asciidoc.attributes.policy-number}} {{/with}} Passing the page.relativeSrcPath value to the built-in resolvePage helper resolves to the current page. The model=false option instructions the helper to return the virtual file rather than the UI model for the resolved page. From there, all the AsciiDoc attributes can be access through the nested asciidoc.attributes property. Antora automatically sets a number of read-only, intrinsic page attributes at runtime that are derived from existing metadata about the current page. For example, the name of the current component can be read from the page-component-name attribute. These attributes are defined at the time the page or navigation file is loaded (i.e., parsed) They are not yet assigned when the attributes in the component descriptor are resolved, and are thus not visible to the component descriptor. The intrinsic page attributes are listed on Intrinsic Attributes. These attributes are read-only, so you should not override their values in the page header.","title":"Page Attributes","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"page-attributes","url":"/antora/3.1/page/page-attributes.html","titles":[{"text":"Purpose and anatomy","hash":"purpose-and-anatomy","id":1},{"text":"Define a custom page attribute","hash":"custom-attribute","id":2},{"text":"Promote a non-page attribute","hash":"promote-a-non-page-attribute","id":3},{"text":"Configure a predefined page attribute","hash":"configure-a-predefined-page-attribute","id":4},{"text":"Access page attributes from the UI template","hash":"access-attributes-from-ui-template","id":5},{"text":"Intrinsic page attributes","hash":"intrinsic-page-attributes","id":6}]},"153":{"id":153,"text":"Antora provides a page attribute named page-layout. This attribute applies an alternate UI layout to the contents of a page. The page-layout attribute is optional. It’s defined in the header of a page using an AsciiDoc attribute entry. = Page Title :page-layout: tiles The page-layout attribute accepts the filename of a UI layout file without the file extension. For example, if you want a page to use the layout file tiles.hbs, assign the value tiles to page-layout. The associated layout file (e.g., tiles.hbs) is expected to be located in the UI bundle’s layouts directory. When the page-layout attribute is explicitly set in the header of a page, it overrides the default layout.

The AsciiDoc xref macro only requires the file coordinate of the target page’s resource ID when the current page and target page belong to the same component version and module. The target page is the page source file that’s being referenced by the current page. The target page is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an xref macro in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the xref macro that references the target page. Example 1 shows the file coordinate of the target page assigned to an xref macro in the current page. Example 1. current-page.adoc xref:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional link text] (1) xref:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc#fragment[optional link text] (2) 1 For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an xref macro, see Make a link with the xref macro. 2 An optional fragment, representing an element ID in the target page, can be assigned after the target page’s file coordinate. The file coordinate of the target page is always calculated from the root of the pages family directory. That means the structure of the target page’s file coordinate depends on whether the target page is stored at the root of the pages family directory or in a subdirectory of the pages directory. Example 2. File coordinate structure of target page xref:target-page-filename.adoc[optional link text] (1) xref:path/to/target-page-filename.adoc[optional link text] (2) xref:./target-page-filename.adoc[optional link text] (3) 1 File coordinate of the target page when it’s stored at the root of the pages directory. 2 File coordinate of the target page when it’s stored in a subdirectory of the pages directory, but the current page isn’t stored in the same subdirectory. 3 File coordinate of the target page when the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory of the pages directory. The following sections provide examples of the file coordinate structures. When the target page is stored at the root of the pages family directory, the file coordinate is the target page’s filename and file extension. Example 3. File coordinate when target page is stored at the root of a pages directory xref:target-page-filename.adoc[optional link text] Let’s use a few of the pages listed in Example 4 as the basis for the examples in this section. Example 4. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 ridge.adoc 📄 willow-creek.adoc 📂 ROOT (4) 📂 pages (5) 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines subsequent files as pages 4 Defines the ROOT module 5 Defines subsequent files as pages Using the two pages that belong to the la-garita module, shown in Example 4 above, let’s reference willow-creek.adoc from ridge.adoc. That means the source file willow-creek.adoc is the target page and ridge.adoc is the current page. Example 5 shows an xref macro in the ridge.adoc page that links to the willow-creek.adoc page. Example 5. ridge.adoc (current page) The xref:willow-creek.adoc[trailhead] is north of town. The file coordinate for the willow-creek.adoc page consists solely of its filename and file extension, willow-creek.adoc, because it’s stored at the root of the pages directory. The file coordinate of the target page is always calculated from the root of the pages family directory. Let’s look at another xref macro, shown in Example 6, that references the ranges.adoc page (target page) from the index.adoc page (current page). Example 6. index.adoc (current page) The Rocky Mountains consists of xref:ranges.adoc[numerous mountain ranges]. Only the file coordinate of the target page needs to be specified in the xref macro because both pages belong to the ROOT module and the colorado 5.2 component version. The file coordinate for ranges.adoc is ranges.adoc because it’s stored at the root of the pages directory. See File coordinate with pages-relative directory path and File coordinate with relative path token for file coordinate examples when the target page is stored in a subdirectory pages directory. The pages-relative directory path of the target page is required in its file coordinate when the current page isn’t stored in the same subdirectory as the target page. If both pages are stored in the same subdirectory, see File coordinate with relative path token. Example 7. File coordinate when the target page is stored in a subdirectory of a pages directory xref:path/to/target-page-filename.adoc[optional link text] Let’s reference faq.adoc from ranges.adoc. As you can see in Example 8, both pages belong to the ROOT module of the colorado 5.2 component version. Example 8. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (2) 📂 pages (3) 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 📂 terms (4) 📄 faq.adoc 📄 signs.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines the ROOT module 3 Defines subsequent source files as pages 4 A subdirectory in pages containing the source files of pages The xref macro in Example 9 creates a link to the faq.adoc page (target page) from the ranges.adoc page (current page). Example 9. ranges.adoc (current page) See the xref:terms/faq.adoc[]. As shown in Example 9, the file coordinate for faq.adoc is terms/faq.adoc. The file coordinate assigned to the xref macro consists of the target page’s pages-relative directory path in addition to its filename and file extension because faq.adoc is stored in the subdirectory terms. In cases where the current page and target page are stored in the same subdirectory, you can use the relative path token, ./, in place of the pages-relative directory path. If the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory in the pages directory, the pages-relative directory path of the target page’s file coordinate can be replaced with the relative path token, ./. Example 10. File coordinate when the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory xref:./target-page-filename.adoc[optional link text] Let’s reference faq.adoc from signs.adoc. Example 11 shows that both files are stored in the terms subdirectory of the pages directory, and that both files belong to the same module and component version. Example 11. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml 📂 modules 📂 ROOT (1) 📂 pages (2) 📄 index.adoc 📂 terms (3) 📄 faq.adoc 📄 signs.adoc 1 Defines the ROOT module 2 Defines subsequent source files as pages 3 A subdirectory in pages containing the source files of pages When the target page and current page are stored in the same subdirectory in the pages directory, the relative path token, ./, can be used to abbreviate the target page’s file coordinate. The xref macro in Example 10 links to the faq.adoc page (target page) from the signs.adoc page (current page). Example 12. signs.adoc (current page) See the xref:./faq.adoc[]. As shown in Example 12, the file coordinate for faq.adoc, when referenced from signs.adoc, is ./faq.adoc. Both pages are stored in the terms subdirectory, therefore, the pages-relative directory path of the target page’s file coordinate is replaced with the ./ token. When the target page and current page don’t belong to the same module, you must specify the module coordinate and file coordinate of the target page in the xref macro. Example 13. Module and file coordinate of target page assigned to an xref macro xref:module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional link text] (1) 1 Assign the module and file coordinates of the target page to the xref macro when the target page and current page belong to the same component version but not the same module. Using two pages from the colorado 5.2 component version, shown in Example 14, let’s reference ranges.adoc from willow-creek.adoc. Example 14. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita (2) 📂 pages 📄 willow-creek.adoc 📂 ROOT (3) 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 2 Defines a module named la-garita 3 Defines the ROOT module The willow-creek.adoc page belongs to the la-garita module, but ranges.adoc belongs to the ROOT module. The xref macro in Example 15 links to ranges.adoc (target page) from the page willow-creek.adoc (current page). Example 15. willow-creek.adoc (current page) Only xref:ROOT:ranges.adoc[one pass is open] in the winter. As shown in Example 15, the target page’s module coordinate is ROOT and its file coordinate is ranges.adoc. When the target page and current page belong to different documentation components, you must specify, at a minimum, the target page’s component, module, and file coordinates in the xref macro. You’ll almost always specify the version coordinate, too. Example 16. Version, component, module, and file coordinates assigned to an xref macro xref:version@component:module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional link text] (1) xref:component:module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional link text] (2) 1 Assign the version, component, module, and file coordinates of the target page to the xref macro when the target page and current page don’t belong to the same component versions. 2 If the version coordinate isn’t specified, Antora uses the latest version of the target page’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. This behavior only applies when the target page and current page belong to different docs components. Let’s reference elevation.adoc from index.adoc. The index.adoc page belongs to the component version colorado 5.2 (Example 17). The elevation.adoc page belongs to the component version wyoming 1.0 (Example 18). Example 17. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita 📂 pages 📄 willow-creek.adoc 📂 ROOT 📂 pages 📄 index.adoc 📄 ranges.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 Example 18. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre 📂 pages 📄 elevation.adoc 📄 wilderness-areas.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.0 In Example 19, the xref macro links to the elevation.adoc page (target page) from index.adoc (current page) . Example 19. index.adoc (current page) Do you know xref:1.0@wyoming:sierra-madre:elevation.adoc[how elevation is measured]? Because the target page belongs to the wyoming 1.0 component version whereas the current page belongs to colorado 5.2, the resource ID assigned to the xref macro specifies the version, component, module, and file coordinates of the target page. As shown in Example 19, the target page’s version coordinate is 1.0, its component coordinate is wyoming, its module coordinate is sierra-madre, and its file coordinate is elevation.adoc. In Example 20, the page ranges.adoc is referenced from the page elevation.adoc. The target page, ranges.adoc, belongs to the ROOT module of colorado 5.2 whereas the current page belongs to wyoming 1.0. Example 20. elevation.adoc (current page) xref:5.2@colorado::ranges.adoc[] Notice in Example 20 that the module coordinate ROOT seems to be missing from the resource ID. When a component coordinate is specified in a resource ID, and the target page belongs to the ROOT module, the module coordinate ROOT doesn’t have to be explicitly specified. But you must still enter the colon (:) that would follow the module coordinate. You can see this : directly before the file coordinate ranges.adoc. This shorthand only works when a component coordinate is specified and the module coordinate of the target page is ROOT. In all other cases where the module coordinate is required, the name of the module must be specified. This behavior only applies when the target page and current page belong to different docs components! If a version isn’t specified in the resource ID assigned to an xref macro, and the target page and current page don’t belong to the same component, Antora uses the version coordinate of the latest version of the target page’s component to complete the resource ID at runtime. Let’s reference the elevation.adoc page (target page) from the willow-creek.adoc page (current page). elevation.adoc belongs to the component version wyoming 1.0 (Example 21). willow-creek.adoc belongs to component version colorado 5.2 (Example 22) . Example 21. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre 📂 pages 📄 elevation.adoc 📄 wilderness-areas.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.0 Example 22. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita 📂 pages 📄 willow-creek.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 If you always want the xref macro in Example 23 to link to the latest version of the elevation.adoc page, don’t specify a version coordinate in the target page’s resource ID. Example 23. willow-creek.adoc (current page) xref:wyoming:sierra-madre:elevation.adoc[How are peaks measured]? (1) 1 Directly after the macro prefix, xref:, assign the resource ID of the target page starting with its component coordinate. When Antora runs, it will identify wyoming 1.0 as the latest version of the wyoming component according to its version sorting rules and latest version criteria. Because a version coordinate isn’t specified in Example 23, Antora will complete the resource ID assigned to the xref macro using the version coordinate — 1.0 — from the latest wyoming component. Remember, this behavior only applies if the target page and current page belong to different components. After a few months, let’s add the new component version wyoming 1.5, shown in Example 24, to your site. Example 24. Directories and files assigned to wyoming 1.5 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 sierra-madre 📂 pages 📄 elevation.adoc 📄 wilderness-areas.adoc 1 Defines the component version as wyoming 1.5 The next time the site is generated, Antora will determine that wyoming 1.5 (not wyoming 1.0) is the latest version of the wyoming component. Example 25. willow-creek.adoc (current page) xref:wyoming:sierra-madre:elevation.adoc[How are peaks measured]? Because Antora now identifies wyoming 1.5 as the latest version of the wyoming component, Antora will complete the resource ID of the target page in Example 25 with the version coordinate — 1.5 — of the latest wyoming component at runtime. This behavior of linking to the latest version only applies when the version coordinate is unspecified and the target page and current page belong to different components. If the version and component coordinates aren’t specified in the resource ID, Antora assumes the target page belongs to the same component version as the current page and uses the current page’s version and component coordinates to complete the target page’s resource ID. When the current page and target page belong to the same component, but the target page belongs to a different version of the component, you’ll specify the version, module (if it’s different than the current page’s module), and file coordinates. Example 26. current-page.adoc xref:version@module:file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional link text] (1) xref:version@file-coordinate-of-target-page.adoc[optional link text] (2) 1 Assign the version, module, and file coordinates of the target page to the xref macro when the target page doesn’t belong to the same version and module as the current page. 2 Assign the version and file coordinates of the target page to the xref macro when the target page doesn’t belong to the same version as the current page. Let’s use the pages that belong to colorado 5.2 (Example 27) and colorado 6.0 (Example 28) as the basis for the example in this section. Example 27. Directories and files assigned to colorado 5.2 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 get-started 📂 pages 📄 tour.adoc 📂 la-garita 📂 pages 📄 willow-creek.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 5.2 Example 28. Directories and files assigned to colorado 6.0 📄 antora.yml (1) 📂 modules 📂 la-garita 📂 pages 📄 willow-creek.adoc 1 Defines the component version as colorado 6.0 Notice that the colorado 5.2 component version in Example 27 has a tour.adoc page that belongs to the get-started module. However, colorado 6.0, shown in Example 28, has no such module or page. Let’s reference tour.adoc (target page) from the page willow-creek.adoc (current page) that belongs to the colorado 6.0 component version. In Example 29, the resource ID assigned to the xref macro specifies the target page’s version, module, and file coordinates because the target page belongs to a different version and module than the current page. Example 29. willow-creek.adoc (current page) in colorado 6.0 Last year's xref:5.2@get-started:tour.adoc[excursions] were riveting! As shown in Example 29, the target page’s version coordinate is 5.2, its module coordinate is get-started, and its file coordinate is tour.adoc.","title":"Create Page Links","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"page-links","url":"/antora/3.1/page/page-links.html","titles":[{"text":"Page links within a module","hash":"pages","id":1},{"text":"File coordinate at pages directory root","hash":"pages-root","id":2},{"text":"File coordinate with pages-relative directory path","hash":"relative-path","id":3},{"text":"File coordinate with relative path token","hash":"relative-path-token","id":4},{"text":"Page links between modules","hash":"modules","id":5},{"text":"Page links between component versions","hash":"component-versions","id":6},{"text":"Link to the latest version of a page","hash":"latest-version","id":7},{"text":"Page links between versions of a component","hash":"versions","id":8}]},"155":{"id":155,"text":"As Antora processes each page, it converts the contents of the file from AsciiDoc to HTML. (Within a component version, pages are typically processed in order by module and relative filename). The conversion of the contents from AsciiDoc to HTML would normally impact the behavior of the include directive. Specifically, a page that uses the include directive to include a page that has already been processed would see HTML instead of AsciiDoc. To rectify this ordering problem, Antora can retain the AsciiDoc source until all pages have been converted. This behavior is activated by setting the page-partial attribute in the document header of the page. As of Antora 2.2, the page-partial attribute is (soft) set globally by default. (Soft set means that it can still be overridden by the page). So, really, you don’t even have to think of it. It will just work. The downside of retaining the AsciiDoc source is that it may increase the peak heap usage of Antora for very large sites by ~ 10%. If that’s a concern, you can revert to the previous “a la carte” behavior. To revert to the previous behavior (prior to Antora 2.2), set the following property in the playbook file: asciidoc: attributes: page-partial: false The page-partial attribute will no longer be set globally. Now you must set the page-partial attribute on any page you want to use in an include directive. For example: = Shared Page :page-partial: Page contents. With the page-partial attribute set, you can safely refer to that page using the include directive: include::shared-page.adoc[] Recall that the page-partial attribute in the included page instructs Antora to retain the AsciiDoc source until all pages have been converted.","title":"Unset page-partial Globally","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"page-partial","url":"/antora/3.1/page/page-partial.html","titles":[]},"156":{"id":156,"text":"Partials are good for storing snippets of content, such as common descriptions, project introductions, terminology, frequent admonitions, and reference tables, that you reuse in one or more pages throughout your site. Changes you make to a partial will disseminate to all of the pages where you referenced the partial the next time you build your site. Partial files are stored in a partials directory. A partial file is usually marked up with AsciiDoc and saved with the .adoc file extension. However, a partial isn’t required to be an AsciiDoc file and, unlike publishable resources, a partial file without a file extension isn’t treated as a hidden file. Antora will load a partial that doesn’t have a file extension into its content catalog and assign the partial a resource ID for referencing. When saving a new partial file, keep the following filename requirements and recommendations in mind: A partial’s filename can’t contain spaces because the AsciiDoc include directive doesn’t accept values with spaces. Uppercase letters aren’t recommended in filenames. Some file systems aren’t case sensitive. Therefore, file conflicts could occur depending on the file system a writer is using. Save a partial file with the .adoc extension when it’s an AsciiDoc file, otherwise use the valid file extension for the file type. You should only save a partial without a file extension when it’s common industry practice for that specific file type to not have an extension. Not using the correct file extension when saving a partial file may limit your ability to apply some Antora extensions or upgrade to future capabilities. Antora doesn’t publish partial files as individual site pages. A partial must be referenced by an include directive from a page, or resource that’s eventually included in a page, for the partial’s content to be published. A partial is usually regular content marked up with AsciiDoc. Unlike a page, a partial doesn’t have any required structural elements, such as a title, though it can contain such elements. In the next section, you’ll see how to create a new partial file and mark it up with AsciiDoc. Open a new file in your IDE or plain text editor. On the first line of the file, enter your content, such as paragraph text, a table, or an attribute entry. In this example, let’s create an admonition that’s going to be used on several pages throughout a site. [WARNING] ==== High, open places above the treeline are awe-inspiring-- but you need to be prepared for the altitude and rapidly changing weather conditions. ==== Once you finish creating your content, save the file with the extension .adoc in a partials directory. 📂 modules 📂 ROOT 📂 pages 📄 a-source-file.adoc 📂 partials 📄 treeline-warning.adoc You’ve created a partial! Now, it’s ready to be included in a page. Regardless of the component version a partial belongs to, it can be referenced by any page or partial in your site using the partial’s resource ID and AsciiDoc include directive. You can even select regions or lines from a partial, instead of all of the partial’s content, and insert only those regions or lines using the include directive’s tag, tags, or lines attributes. As you create the content in a partial, there are certain AsciiDoc elements that you may need to adjust according to the current page’s context and structure. A partial is converted after it’s inserted into a page. Therefore, the current page’s component version, module, attributes, and other elements are applied to and may impact the included content. Xrefs If the partial is included in pages that belong to other modules or docs components, you need to specify the resource ID of a target page or attachment that’s assigned to an xref macro in the partial’s content accordingly. The number of resource ID coordinates required depends on the component version and module of the current page into which the partial is being inserted in relation to the target attachment or page being referenced by an xref macro in the partial’s content. Images, examples, and other partials A partial can reference other partials and examples using the include directive and images using the image macros. Like when entering resource IDs in xrefs, the resource ID of the target resource may need additional coordinates specified depending on the component version and module of the current page that partial is being included into and the resource being referenced in the partial. A partial can contain section headings. You may need to use the leveloffset attribute to adjust the partial’s heading levels, depending on where you enter the referencing include directive in a current page. Element IDs in a partial can’t conflict with the element IDs of the page into which it’s being inserted. Attributes can be set, assigned, and referenced in a partial. When an attribute is referenced in a partial, either the partial, current page, or current page’s component version descriptor must set and assign a value to the attribute.

You can customize the values of these attributes by setting them in the header of a page. A target page’s reftext value is used as the link text in an xref that originates from a page or resource file. By default, Antora assigns a page’s title to the reftext attribute at runtime. In Example 1, let’s reference the install-prerequisites.adoc file and leave the link text field empty. Example 1. current-page.adoc Make sure you xref:install-prerequisites.adoc[]. Now, let’s look at the header of the install-prerequisites.adoc file. Example 2. install-prerequisites.adoc = Installing and Testing Silver Leaf's Prerequisites Here are the prerequisites: Notice in Example 2 that reftext isn’t set in the page’s header. That means its title, Installing and Testing Silver Leaf’s Prerequisites, will be automatically assigned to reftext at runtime and used in Example 1 as the xref’s link text. If you don’t want a page’s title to be used as its default reftext, assign the attribute a custom value with an attribute entry. Example 3 shows the reftext attribute being assigned a custom value. Example 3. Assign a custom reftext value = Installing and Testing Silver Leaf's Prerequisites :reftext: Install Silver Leaf's Prerequisites Here are the prerequisites: When the site is generated, the value of reftext, Install Silver Leaf’s Prerequisites, will be used in Example 1 as the xref’s link text. It will also be used as the page’s navtitle value. When the resource ID of the target page is appended with a fragment, the link text isn’t automatically populated. You’ll need to specify the xref’s link text in such cases. A target page’s navtitle value is used as the link text in an xref that originates from a navigation file. By default, Antora assigns the value of a page’s reftext attribute to navtitle. A page’s reftext is often automatically assigned the page’s title. In Example 4, let’s reference the get-started.adoc file from a navigation file, and leave the link text field empty. Example 4. nav.adoc * xref:index.adoc[] * xref:get-started.adoc[] Now, let’s look at the header of the get-started.adoc file in Example 5.

Antora constructs a resource ID for a source file by assigning values to these coordinates based on the file, standard directory set, and information in the component version descriptor. You can reference a resource from any other resource—​regardless of the component version each resource belongs to—​using a sequence of the resource ID coordinates assigned to a resource. Figure 1 shows the coordinate types and their sequence in a fully qualified resource ID. Figure 1. Fully qualified resource ID A fully qualified resource ID is a resource ID with all of its coordinates specified. You probably won’t have to use a resource’s fully qualified resource ID that often. The number of resource ID coordinates you specify when referencing a resource depends on: the component version and module of the current page in relation to the target resource, the family of the target resource, and the AsciiDoc syntax used to reference the target resource. The target resource is the resource source file that’s referenced, by specifying its resource ID, in an AsciiDoc macro, include directive, or other syntax. The current page is the page file that contains the AsciiDoc syntax that references the target resource. Figure 2. The current page, with the filename satellites.adoc, containing an xref macro referencing a resource In Figure 2, satellites.adoc is the current page and the resource with the filename modes.adoc is the target resource being referenced by the xref macro. The following sections describe how to determine the value of each coordinate for a target resource and when to use each coordinate. The version coordinate is the same value as the version of the component to which the target resource belongs. The value of the version is assigned to the version key. The version key is specified either in the antora.yml file that defines the resource’s component version or on the content source in your playbook that specified from where Antora collected the component version’s files. The version coordinate should be used to reference a resource in a different version of the same component or a specific version of a different component. When entering a version coordinate in a resource ID, it should always be the first coordinate and end with an at sign (@). If the component coordinate is not specified, the current component will be used. If the component coordinate is specified without specifying a version coordinate, the latest version of that component will be choosen. The component coordinate is the name of the component to which the target resource belongs. The component name is specified by the name key in the antora.yml file that defines the resource’s component version. The component coordinate must be used when the target resource and current page belong to different documentation components. The component name is entered before the module coordinate in a resource ID and is directly followed by one colon (:). If the component coordinate is specified without specifying a version coordinate, the latest version of that component will be choosen. The module coordinate is the name of the module to which the target resource belongs. The module name is derived from the module directory where the resource is stored. The module coordinate must be used when the target resource and current page belong to different modules. The module name is entered before the family coordinate, if the family coordinate is present, or before the file coordinate if the family coordinate isn’t present. The module name is directly followed by one colon (:). When a module coordinate ends with the name of a built-in AsciiDoc macro, such as link, kbd, menu, etc., you may have to escape that portion of the coordinate by prefixing the macro name with a backslash. For example, module coordinates such as monolink and redmenu may need to be entered as mono\\link and red\\menu in a resource ID. The family coordinate identifies the name of the family to which the target resource belongs. The family is derived from the family directory where the resource is stored. Remove the “s” at the end of the family’s name and replace it with a dollar sign ($) when constructing a resource ID. The valid family coordinates are page$, image$, partial$, example$, and attachment$. Whether the family coordinate needs to be entered in a resource ID depends on: the family of the target resource, and the AsciiDoc syntax used to reference the target resource. For example, if you reference a page using the xref macro, the page$ family coordinate isn’t required because the xref macro applies it by default when no family coordinate is specified. The following table lists when the family coordinate is required depending on the resource being referenced and the syntax that is referencing the resource. Resource being referenced Syntax referencing the resource Family coordinate required? Attachment Xref macro Yes, the attachment$ coordinate is required. See Attachments. Example Include directive Yes, the example$ coordinate is required. See Include an Example. Image Block image macro No, the family coordinate isn’t required. See Add Block Images and Image Resource ID Examples. Inline image macro No, the family coordinate isn’t required. See Add Inline Images and Image Resource ID Examples. Xref macro Yes, the image$ coordinate is required. Page Xref macro No, the family coordinate isn’t required. See Xref Macros and Page Links. Include directive No, the family coordinate isn’t required. See Include a Page. Partial Include directive Yes, the partial$ coordinate is required. See Include a Partial. The file coordinate specifies the path, relative to the family directory, of the target resource’s source file. The file coordinate must specify the resource’s file extension except when: the target resource doesn’t have a file extension, such as Dockerfile, and the target resource is a partial or example. The file coordinate for a resource stored at the root of a family directory is the name of the resource’s source file and its file extension. Example 1. Resource stored at root of family directory 📂 modules 📂 admin 📂 pages (1) 📄 modes.adoc (2) 1 pages family directory 2 Page stored at the root of the pages directory For example, the file coordinate for modes.adoc, shown in Example 1, is modes.adoc because it’s stored at the root of the pages family directory. If the target resource is located in a subdirectory of a family directory, the file coordinate must specify the family-relative directory path to the target resource. Example 2. Resource stored in subdirectory of family directory 📂 modules 📂 admin 📂 pages 📄 modes.adoc (1) 📂 fields (2) 📂 level (3) 📄 routes.adoc (4) 📄 terrain.adoc (5) 1 Page stored at the root of the pages directory 2 Subdirectory in the pages directory 3 Subdirectory in the fields subdirectory 4 Page stored in level subdirectory 5 Page stored in level subdirectory The page terrain.adoc, shown in Example 2, is stored in the level subdirectory. The file coordinate for terrain.adoc is fields/level/terrain.adoc. If modes.adoc (current page) references terrain.adoc (target resource), the file coordinate specified in the target resource’s resource ID is fields/level/terrain.adoc. If terrain.adoc (current page) references modes.adoc (target resource), the file coordinate specified in the target resource’s resource ID is modes.adoc. Remember, the file coordinate of the target resource is always calculated from the family directory. When the target resource and current page are both located in the same subdirectory of a family directory, the relative path token, ./, can be used to abbreviate the family-relative directory path of the target resource’s file coordinate. Example 3. Resources stored in the same subdirectory 📂 modules 📂 admin 📂 pages 📂 fields 📂 level 📄 routes.adoc (1) 📄 terrain.adoc (2) 1 Page stored in level subdirectory 2 Page stored in level subdirectory The pages routes.adoc and terrain.adoc, shown in Example 3, are both stored in the level subdirectory. If routes.adoc (current page) references terrain.adoc (target resource), the file coordinate specified in the target resource’s resource ID can be specified as ./terrain.adoc instead of fields/level/terrain.adoc.","title":"Resource ID Coordinates","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"resource-id-coordinates","url":"/antora/3.1/page/resource-id-coordinates.html","titles":[{"text":"Coordinate syntax and order","hash":"id-coordinates","id":1},{"text":"Version coordinate","hash":"id-version","id":2},{"text":"Component coordinate","hash":"id-component","id":3},{"text":"Module coordinate","hash":"id-module","id":4},{"text":"Family coordinate","hash":"id-family","id":5},{"text":"File coordinate","hash":"id-resource","id":6}]},"159":{"id":159,"text":"A resource is a source file that belongs to the pages, images, partials, examples, or attachments family. Antora assigns each resource a unique identifier called an Antora resource ID. A publishable resource is a source file that belongs to the pages, attachments, or images family. Antora automatically publishes page, attachment, and image files to your site, even if they aren’t referenced in another resource. This is in contrast to partial and example files. The content of a partial or example is only published if it’s referenced—​either directly or by way of another partial or example that is eventually referenced—​from a publishable resource. An Antora resource ID, or resource ID for short, is a unique and reliable set of identifying coordinates, organized in a standard sequence, that Antora automatically constructs from the properties assigned to each resource’s source file. You’ll often use the resource ID of a resource to reference it from another resource. A resource is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an AsciiDoc xref macro, include directive, image macro, or the few keys, attributes, or options that accept a resource ID as a value. Antora then uses the assigned resource ID to look up the corresponding resource in its virtual file system. Resource ID Coordinates describes the coordinates in a resource ID, where you find a resource’s coordinates, and when you use each of the coordinates. They’re not coupled to a published URL because they’re a source-to-source reference. Notice the page coordinate ends with .adoc, the file extension of an AsciiDoc source file. Regardless of whether you’re deploying your site locally, to a staging or production environment, or you change URL strategies, the resource ID always remains the same. The xref locks on to the target page and produces a URL that points to it wherever it gets published. They’re minimally coupled to the filesystem by using an identifier based on the Antora’s virtual component version classification system. They’ve eliminated the relative path (../../) problem by specifying the resource as a family-relative directory path. The path always starts from a family directory, even when the referencing resource is located inside a subdirectory of the family directory. This human-friendly referencing system saves you from having to do computations in your head while writing. You just specify the coordinates of the page you want to reference. There’s no need to worry about the source file’s physical location on disk or its published URL. All you need to know are the names of your components, versions, modules, and pages so you can fill in this information. Antora does not permit two resources (i.e., source files) to share the same resource ID. This situation can occur under the following conditions: the antora.yml file in more than one content source root declares the same name and version both content source roots have at least one file located at the same relative path (beginning from the start path) the conflicting files are both collected and classified by Antora If this situation occurs, Antora will report the conflicting files by logging a fatal error and immediately stop building the site. Which error you see depends on the order in which files are discovered. If both component versions declare navigation files, you’ll likely see a duplicate nav file error: Duplicate nav in 1.0@name-of-component: modules/ROOT/nav.adoc 1: modules/ROOT/nav.adoc in https://git-host/repo-name.git (branch: v1.0.x)\\n' + 2: modules/ROOT/nav.adoc in https://git-host/repo-name.git (tag: v1.0.0)' Otherwise, you’ll see an error about a duplicate page or other resource: Duplicate page: modules/ROOT/index.adoc in 1.0@name-of-component 1: modules/ROOT/nav.adoc in https://git-host/repo-name.git (branch: v1.0.x)\\n' + 2: modules/ROOT/nav.adoc in https://git-host/repo-name.git (tag: v1.0.0)' What this error is telling you is that two files are trying to claim the same resource ID. This could indicate you have a redundant content source root configured in your playbook or that you’ve forgetten to update the version key in one of the antora.yml files. Study the git references that Antora cites to discover the cause. If you’re attempting to define a distributed component version, in which case the antora.yml will declare the same name and version, then you need to remove the conflicting file from one of the two roots so there’s no overlap.","title":"Resources and Resource IDs","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"resource-id","url":"/antora/3.1/page/resource-id.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s a resource?","hash":"whats-a-resource","id":1},{"text":"What’s a publishable resource?","hash":"publishable","id":2},{"text":"What’s a resource ID?","hash":"whats-a-resource-id","id":3},{"text":"Why are resource IDs important?","hash":"important","id":4},{"text":"Duplicate resources","hash":"duplicate-resources","id":5}]},"160":{"id":160,"text":"A standard page has two parts, a header and a body.

An AsciiDoc xref macro is used to create a source-to-source cross reference from a resource to a publishable resource. The term cross reference, which is often abbreviated to xref, means to use the AsciiDoc xref macro to reference the source file of a publishable resource. The xref macro accepts an Antora resource ID specifying a publishable page, attachment, or, occasionally, an image, as a value. When Antora runs, an xref macro and its value are converted into a link to the target resource’s published URL. Figure 1 shows the structure of an xref macro. Figure 1. Xref macro structure for referencing a page At a minimum, an xref macro consists of the macro’s prefix (xref:), the resource ID of the target page, and a set of square brackets ([]). The target page is the page source file that’s being referenced by the current page. The target page is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an xref macro in the content of the current page. The current page is the page source file containing the xref macro that references the target page. Each part of the xref macro shown in Figure 1 is described in more detail below. xref: An xref macro begins with the macro’s name, xref, followed by a single colon (:). resource ID of target page The xref macro accepts the resource ID of a page as its value. The value is entered directly after the colon that follows the macro’s name (xref:). How many of the target page’s resource ID coordinates you need to specify depends on the component version and module of the target page in relation to the current page. The page$ family coordinate isn’t required in the resource ID when the target resource is a page. Also, remember that the file coordinate of a target page is calculated from the pages family directory. #fragment A fragment is an element ID that links to a section, block, or inline location within the target page. Fragments are also referred to as deep links. A fragment is optional. The fragment starts with the hash symbol (#) and is entered directly after the resource ID of the target page. A target page’s reference text, whether assigned by default or using the reftext attribute, isn’t used as link text when a fragment is specified. [link text] The xref macro is completed with a set of square brackets ([]) at the end of the target page’s resource ID, or, if specified, at the end of the fragment. You can enter optional text between these brackets or leave them empty. When Antora converts the xref macro and its value into a link, the text entered between the square brackets is displayed in the current page when it’s published to your site. If no link text is specified between the macro’s square brackets, and the value of the xref macro doesn’t contain a fragment, then the target page’s default reference text or text assigned to the reftext attribute is displayed in the current page when it’s published. If a fragment is appended to the resource ID of the target page and no link text is entered between the brackets, then the URL of the published target page is displayed. The next section explains how to create a cross reference step-by-step. Let’s break down the xref macro and resource ID coordinates you need to create a cross reference to a page (the target page) from a page that you’re currently editing (the current page). In your IDE or text editor, open the page where you want to create a cross reference. For this step and the subsequent steps, let’s assume you’ve opened the file satellites.adoc. satellites.adoc is the current page. Example 1. satellites.adoc (current page) === Console options See the In the current page, select the location in the content flow where you want the link to the target page to be displayed. Enter the name of the xref macro followed by one colon, xref:. Example 2. satellites.adoc (current page) === Console options See the xref: Assign the resource ID of the target page to the xref macro. In Example 3, let’s use modes.adoc as the target page and assume that it and the current page, satellites.adoc, belong to the same component version and module. Therefore, only the file coordinate of the target page needs to be specified. Example 3. satellites.adoc (current page) === Console options See the xref:modes.adoc The file coordinate for the modes.adoc page is modes.adoc. The target page’s file coordinate consists solely of its filename and file extension because it’s stored at the root of the pages directory. The resource ID for modes.adoc doesn’t include the page$ family coordinate. The xref macro assumes the family coordinate is page$ when it isn’t specified. Directly after the resource ID of the target page, enter an opening square bracket ([), then a closing square bracket (]), followed by any subsequent content. Example 4. satellites.adoc (current page) === Console options See the xref:modes.adoc[] for more options. We didn’t enter any text between the macro’s square brackets because we want the target page’s reference text to be used as the link text. When Antora converts the xref macro and target page’s resource ID, it will automatically populate the link text with the target page’s default reference text or text assigned to the reftext attribute. That’s it! You’ve created a cross reference to the target page (modes.adoc) from the current page (satellites.adoc) using the AsciiDoc xref macro. Create Page Links shows how to create xrefs to pages when the target page is stored in a subdirectory or it belongs to another module, component, or version.

The playbook is where you configure the site, content sources, and UI URLs. A playbook file usually has the word playbook in its filename, e.g., antora-playbook.yml or local-antora-playbook.yml. A component version descriptor is where you configure the name, version, metadata, attributes, and navigation list of a component version. A component version descriptor’s filename is always antora.yml. Site attributes are mapped under the attributes key in a playbook. The attributes key must be set under the asciidoc key. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml asciidoc: attributes: hide-uri-scheme: '' page-team: Coco B table-caption: ~ listing-caption: Snippet@ Site attributes are applied and available to all of a site’s pages according to the attribute precedence rules. Each site attribute is entered on its own line as a key-value pair under the attributes key. Example 2. Declare attributes in the playbook asciidoc: (1) attributes: (2) listing-caption: Snippet (3) hide-uri-scheme: '' (4) page-team: Coco B (5) db: graphical-peaks-pack.db (6) 1 Enter the asciidoc key, followed by a colon (:), and press Enter. 2 The attributes key is nested under the asciidoc key. Enter attributes, followed by a colon (:), and press Enter. 3 Site attributes are nested under the attributes key. Enter the name of the attribute, followed by a colon (:). Press spacebar once after the colon, then enter the value of the attribute. 4 To set an attribute without specifying an explicit value, assign an empty string by entering two consecutive single quotation marks ('') in the value part. For certain built-in attributes, an empty value is equivalent to the default value, though it depends on the attribute. Although using the boolean value true often works in this case, attribute values in AsciiDoc are strings, so it will likely be coerced to the string value 'true'. 5 To declare a custom page attribute, type page- and the name of your attribute, followed by a colon (:). Press spacebar once after the colon, then enter the value of the attribute. 6 This custom attribute, like the previous three attributes, is hard set. The attributes in Example 2 are all hard set. Hard set site attributes cannot be overridden from a component version descriptor or a page. By default, an attribute is hard set when it’s assigned a value that isn’t reserved for unsetting the attribute (i.e., false or ~) and doesn’t end with a modifier (i.e., @). To allow a component version or page to modify or unset a site attribute, you need to soft set the site attribute. Attributes set in the playbook are site-wide and, thus, available to every page in your site. The values of custom attributes, such as page-team and db can be displayed in a page using the AsciiDoc attribute reference syntax (e.g., {page-team}, {db}). Site attributes can also be referenced from the value of another site attribute, component version attribute, or page attribute. Soft set site attributes can be overridden from a component version descriptor or page. An attribute is soft set in a playbook by attaching the @ modifier to the end of its value. Example 3. Assign soft set precedence to attributes asciidoc: attributes: page-team: Coco B@ (1) hide-uri-scheme: '@' (2) 1 To soft set an attribute that’s assigned an explicit value, attach the @ modifier to the end of its value. 2 To soft set and assign a built-in attribute’s default value, or in the case of a boolean attribute, the empty string value, type an opening single quotation mark, followed by the @ modifier, and then a closing single quotation mark ('). Since the site attributes in Example 3 are soft set, a component version descriptor or page could modify their values or unset them. The value of any site attribute set earlier in the playbook or from the CLI can be inserted into the value of a site attribute using an AsciiDoc attribute reference (e.g., {page-team}). Example 4. A site attribute that references the value of another site attribute asciidoc: attributes: page-team: Coco B@ db: graphical-peaks-pack.db test-server: http://localhost:9090/{db} A site attribute can also be referenced in the value of a component version attribute or page attribute. To prevent an attribute reference substitution, insert a backslash in front of the reference (e.g., \\{not-substituted}). In this case, the attribute reference will not be substituted and the backslash will be omitted. Site attributes can also be unset in a playbook. Site attributes are hard unset when they’re assigned the reserved tilde symbol (~) value. Each site attribute is entered on its own line as a key-value pair under the attributes key. Example 5. Hard unset site attributes in the playbook asciidoc: attributes: figure-caption: ~ (1) hide-uri-scheme: ~ (2) 1 To hard unset an attribute, assign it the tilde symbol (~). ~ is shorthand in YAML for nil, which is a reserved value that hard unsets a site attribute. 2 Boolean attributes are also hard unset when assigned the tilde symbol (~). Hard unset site attributes cannot be overridden from a component version descriptor or a page. When a site attribute is hard unset, its behavior is turned off and it isn’t available to the site’s pages. Soft unset site attributes can be overridden from a component version descriptor or page. An attribute is soft unset in a playbook by assigning it the reserved value false. Example 6. Assign soft unset precedence to attributes asciidoc: attributes: figure-caption: false (1) hide-uri-scheme: false (2) 1 To soft unset an attribute, assign it the value false. 2 Boolean attributes are also soft unset when assigned false. Since the site attributes in Example 6 are soft unset, a component version descriptor or page could reset them. Antora takes the precedence assigned to attributes in the site’s playbook into account first. Site attributes that are hard set and hard unset can’t be changed by a component version descriptor file or a page. However, soft set and unset site attributes can be overridden from the component version descriptor or a page. Hard setting a site attribute using a string value with no trailing @ modifier (e.g., value or '') prevents a component version descriptor or page from changing or unsetting the attribute. Soft setting a site attribute using a string value with a trailing @ modifier (e.g., value@ or '@') allows a component version descriptor or page to change or unset the attribute. Hard unsetting a site attribute using the tilde symbol (~) prevents a component version descriptor or page from setting the attribute. Soft unsetting a site attribute using the false value allows a component version descriptor or page to set the attribute. To learn more about how site attributes interact with component version attributes and page attributes, see Assign Attributes to a Component Version and AsciiDoc Attributes in Antora. Antora defines intrinsic site and page attributes from some of the keys in a playbook file. For instance, Antora sets the built-in attribute site-title and assigns it the value specified by the site.title key. Antora also sets some built-in AsciiDoc attributes, such as sectanchors, by default. See Site and configuration attributes and Intrinsic page attributes for more information. Some built-in AsciiDoc attributes are not applicable in the Antora environment. These attributes include data-uri, allow-uri-read, docinfo, linkcss, noheader, nofooter, webfonts, and outfilesuffix. Setting these attributes either has no effect or may cause Antora to malfunction. Other attributes, such as imagesdir, are automatically set by Antora and cannot be overridden.","title":"Assign Attributes to a Site","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"asciidoc-attributes","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/asciidoc-attributes.html","titles":[{"text":"Site attributes","hash":"site-attributes","id":1},{"text":"attributes key","hash":"attributes-key","id":2},{"text":"Set attributes in the playbook","hash":"hard-set","id":3},{"text":"Soft set attributes","hash":"soft-set","id":4},{"text":"Insert the value of another attribute","hash":"references-in-values","id":5},{"text":"Unset attributes in the playbook","hash":"hard-unset","id":6},{"text":"Soft unset attributes","hash":"soft-unset","id":7},{"text":"Precedence rules","hash":"precedence-rules","id":8},{"text":"Intrinsic site attributes","hash":"intrinsic","id":9}]},"165":{"id":165,"text":"The asciidoc key can be used to register Asciidoctor extensions. Before registering an extension in your playbook, you need to install the extension code. You can install it globally, declare it as a dependency of the project, or add the extension script to the playbook project. An Asciidoctor extension is registered using the extensions key. The extensions key accepts a list of node module names (i.e., npm package names) and relative or absolute filesystem paths. When registering an Asciidoctor extension, make sure you’re using the nested key asciidoc.extensions and not antora.extensions. The latter key is for registering Antora extensions, which use a different extension facility. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml asciidoc: extensions: - name-of-node-module - ./path/to/extension If you’re trying to require a Node.js module (e.g., a package installed from npmjs.com) whose name ends with a file extension, such as .js, you must append a trailing forward slash. For example, the Node.js module highlight.js must be written as highlight.js/. This suffix tells Antora to resolve the request as the name of a module, not as a local file. Without this suffix, Antora assumes the request is a local file. If it’s not a local file, this can result in the error message Cannot find module. If the request is already a local file, the suffix is not needed. Global extensions are registered once, before any pages are converted. These extensions are shared by all documents Antora converts using Asciidoctor (including navigation files). A global extension is a node module or script that exports a function when required. Antora passes this function directly to the register method of Asciidoctor’s static extension registry. To register a global extension, all you need to do is reference its name (if it’s a node module on the require path) or path (if it’s a local script) in the extensions key. Example 2. Register a global extension provided by a node module asciidoc: extensions: - asciidoctor-emoji-macro In this case, asciidoctor-emoji-macro is the name of an installed node module and is thus available on the require path (either in the node_modules directory in the playbook project or in the global node_modules directory). Example 3. Register a global extension from a local script asciidoc: extensions: - ./lib/shout-block In this case, the extension is a script located at the path lib/shout-block.js relative to the playbook file. Here’s an example that shows how to register multiple global extensions: Example 4. Register multiple global extensions asciidoc: extensions: - asciidoctor-emoji-macro - ./lib/shout-block Rather than requiring an extension globally, you may want to register an extension per instance of the AsciiDoc processor. The benefit of this approach is that it allows the extension to hook into the Antora lifecycle. The other difference is that scoped extensions are only registered and used for pages, not for navigation files. In order to register a scoped extension, the extension must support this mode of usage. Specifically, the extension must export a register function that accepts an extension registry on which it self registers. The function is called with a scoped (per-processor) extension registry and a context object. The context object includes the current file, the content catalog, and the AsciiDoc configuration object from the playbook. Here’s an example of a register function for a scoped extension: Example 5. Scoped Asciidoctor extension register function module.exports.register = function (registry, context) { registry.block('shout', createShoutBlock(context)) } A scoped extension is registered in the playbook in exactly the same way as a global extension. Example 6. Register a scoped extension from the require path asciidoc: extensions: - asciidoctor-kroki Example 7. Register a scoped extension from a local script asciidoc: extensions: - ./lib/equation-macro The main difference is that if the extension exports the register function, it gets scoped to the processor instance instead of being registered globally. Instead of registering extensions using the playbook, you can preload extensions using the -r or --require CLI option. The value of this option may be either a path to a file (relative to the current directory), or a node module name. The -r option may be specified multiple times. This option gives site authors the ability to load additional code into the runtime before Antora begins executing, in fact, before Antora is even loaded. The option follows the module resolution rules of the require() function in Node.js. A common use case for this option is to register Asciidoctor extensions globally. If the node module or script is an Asciidoctor extension, it must self-register with Asciidoctor’s static extension registry when required in order for the extension to be used. (Antora merely requires the script. It does not invoke its exported function). Here’s an example showing how to use the Antora CLI to preload multiple Asciidoctor extensions: $ antora -r ./lib/shout-block -r asciidoctor-emoji-macro antora-playbook.yml The -r option can also be used for other purposes, such as to alter global state or override Antora components.

The sourcemap is an AsciiDoc processor feature that tracks and stores the file and line number for each parsed AsciiDoc block. Some Asciidoctor extensions rely on this information to run successfully or return the correct output. Antora’s logger uses this information to add line number and include directive source file location context to the error, warning, and info messages it logs that concern the AsciiDoc syntax. For example, when the AsciiDoc processor’s sourcemap is turned on (activated), Antora’s logger can provide the line number where an unresolved xref is located in a file. If the sourcemap is turned off, the logger can only provide the location of the page file that contains the broken xref. The sourcemap feature is turned on by activating the sourcemap key in your playbook or using the --asciidoc-sourcemap option. The sourcemap key is set to false by default. That is, it’s deactivated (turned off) at runtime unless activated in the playbook or from the CLI using the --asciidoc-sourcemap option. Antora doesn’t activate the sourcemap key by default because it adds additional processing and object allocation to the build process. This may increase the time it takes to generate your site. The optional sourcemap key is mapped to the asciidoc key. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml asciidoc: sourcemap: true To activate the sourcemap key, assign it the value true in the playbook file. You don’t have to modify the playbook file directly to activate or deactivate this key.

Although the primary function of Antora is to generate a site for publishing, it also serves as a tool for the author. By configuring Antora to use a local repository, you can preview local content, including content you haven’t committed. Author mode is activated when you configure the playbook to use a local clone for one or more of the content repositories. Antora will use the repository as it is on your local machine instead of cloning it from its remote location. This scenario assumes you’ve already cloned a repository and want to incorporate it into the site generation. To begin, create a folder named workspace in your project. $ mkdir workspace Switch to the newly created directory and clone one of the repositories: $ git clone https://github.com/my-antora-demo/server-docs workspace/server-docs Next, make a copy of your playbook file for local use. In the example below, antora-playbook.yml is copied and the new file is named local-antora-playbook.yml. $ cp antora-playbook.yml local-antora-playbook.yml Next, open your new playbook file and configure it to use the cloned repository instead of the remote repository. You can specify the repository either as a path relative to the playbook file or as an absolute path. Example 1. local-antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: ./workspace/server-docs branches: HEAD (1) 1 In author mode, you usually want to use the currently checked out HEAD of the local repository Build your Antora site using the new playbook file. $ antora local-antora-playbook.yml The contents of your local repository will be incorporated into the pipeline. If your workspace directory is inside of your playbook repository, it is best to add it to your .gitignore file so as not to push it to the remote. In the previous section, you learned how to configure Antora to use a local repository with a single worktree. If your repository only has a single content branch, this setup works great. However, once you start working with multiple branches, using a single worktree is not ideal. It means having to switch branches each time you need to read or update files in a different component version, making shuffling files between versions very difficult. That’s where multiple worktrees comes into play. A local git repository can support multiple worktrees. The location of the local repository still acts as the main worktree. Using the git worktree command, you can associate additional worktrees with the repository, each mapped to a discrete branch. The new worktree is called a linked worktree. It lives in a directory that’s separate from the main worktree. That means you can effectively have more than one branch checked out at a time for a single repository. Antora recognizes linked worktrees attached to a local content source, provided you have enabled this feature, and will use them if they match one of the branch patterns specified in the playbook. To enable this feature, add worktrees: true to the entry for the content source in the Antora playbook. Follow these steps to set up a local content source with multiple worktrees: Clone the playbook repository. In the folder that git creates for the clone, make a folder named workspace. Switch to the workspace folder and make another folder to hold the worktrees for your content repository (e.g., workspace/software-with-docs) (Note that this is not a git repository). Switch to that folder. Clone the content repository to the folder main (or whatever your default branch is) (e.g., git clone https://github.com/my-antora-demo/server-docs main) Switch to that folder. Now create a worktree for each branch you want to edit using git worktree. For example: git worktree add ../6.0 6.0. The first argument to git worktree add is the location of the worktree and the second is the name of the branch. Typically, you’ll name the worktree folder using the name of the branch. Now return to the playbook repository (where antora-playbook.yml is located) and open the author playbook named local-antora-playbook.yml as described in the previous section, creating it if necessary. In your playbook file, change the URL for the content repository to point to the cloned repository inside the workspace (e.g., ./workspace/software-with-docs/main). You have to point Antora to the main worktree, not one of the linked worktrees. In that same content source entry, enable the worktrees feature by adding worktrees: true. Repeat steps 3-10 for each content repository you want to work with. Now when Antora scans for branches, it will automatically discover the worktrees you have linked and read the files from it (instead of reading them from the git tree). With this setup, you can use the playbook repository as your home base and organize all your content repositories and branches underneath it for authoring. You could create a script in the playbook repository to automate the process of setting up this authoring environment. To learn more about git worktrees and how to use them, refer to the git-worktree page in the git documentation. You may be wondering what branches the generator selects when the repository is local and whether it will pick up your uncommitted changes. Here’s how a local repository is handled: The repository contents on your local machine are used instead of the contents from its remote storage location. The local repository is not updated from its remote storage location; Antora assumes the author will manage the repository (explicitly calling git fetch or git pull on the repository as needed). Here’s how the branches are selected in author mode: Both local branches and remote branches associated with the remote url are considered. If a local branch has the same name as a remote branch, the local branch is chosen. The contents of the worktree get used in place of the files from the current branch. Aside from its name, the current branch is effectively ignored. The current branch of your worktree must match the branches filter configured on the url entry. If not, the working tree will be ignored. You can use the reserved HEAD value to ensure the current working tree is always used. If you want to use multiple worktrees, simply clone the repository multiple times and configure multiple entries in the playbook. You can use the branches key to filter out the names of branches you don’t want.","title":"Use Author Mode","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"author-mode","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/author-mode.html","titles":[{"text":"Activate author mode","hash":"activate-author-mode","id":1},{"text":"Use multiple worktrees","hash":"multiple-worktrees","id":2},{"text":"Author mode order of operations","hash":"author-mode-order-of-operations","id":3}]},"168":{"id":168,"text":"The playbook keys configured under asciidoc apply attributes, Asciidoctor extensions, and additional behavior to the AsciiDoc processor.

The network key holds as the network-related playbook keys, such as the proxy settings. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml network: (1) http_proxy: github.com (2) https_proxy: github.com (3) no_proxy: gitlab.com (4) 1 Optional network category key 2 Optional http_proxy key through which to route HTTP requests 3 Optional https_proxy key through which to route HTTPS requests 4 Optional no_proxy key for HTTP or HTTPS domain request that should bypass proxy The network category key and the child keys it accepts are all optional. When the network key isn’t present in the playbook (and not set via environment variables), Antora falls back to using the default mode for HTTP requests. Git Keys Description Required http_proxy Accepts a URL (e.g., http://localhost:3128) through which to route HTTP requests. Honors the value of the http_proxy environment variable, if set. No https_proxy Accepts a URL (e.g., http://localhost:3128) through which to route HTTPS requests. Honors the value of the https_proxy environment variable, if set. No no_proxy Accepts a comma-separate list of domains of HTTP or HTTPS requests that should not be proxied. Set the value to * to bypass the proxy entirely. Honors the value of the no_proxy environment variable, if set.

The output key accepts the destinations key and its nested list of key-value pairs. The destinations key is required when you want to publish the site files as an archive, use a custom provider, or publish a site to multiple destinations. The destinations key accepts a list of specifications that tell Antora which provider(s) to use to publish the site and where the generated files should be saved. When destinations is set, one or more provider keys must be defined under it. A provider determines which transport protocol (local, SSH, HTTP, etc.) Antora should use when publishing the site and manages the low-level details of publication. Antora has two built-in providers, fs (filesystem) and archive (ZIP archive). provider is also an extension point that can be used to delegate to a custom provider, such as SSH, S3, etc. To disable publishing the site files entirely, including to the default output directory, set destinations to an empty array ([]).

No log.destination.append Configures whether to truncate (i.e., clear) the file before writing to it. The default value is false, which means to truncate the file. No log.destination.buffer_size Sets the amount of memory to use to buffer log messages. Once the buffer reaches this size, the buffered messages are written to the destination in a batch. The default value is 0, which turns off this behavior. No log.destination.sync Configures whether to use a sync or async operation to write log messages to the destination.

When the branches key isn’t specified globally or on a content source, Antora will apply the default branches filter. The branches key is optional. It can be specified directly on the content key (which changes the default value for all content sources) or on a content source (which overrides the default value). The branches key accepts a list of branch name patterns to use from the specified url. Each value can be an exact branch name (e.g., v2.3, main, etc.) or a pattern (e.g., v2.*, v@({1..9})*({0..9}).({0..9}).x+, etc.). The list of branches can also be a combination of these value types. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-z.git branches: [rawhide, 90.0, 93.0, dev] (1) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-y.git branches: main (2) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-x.git branches: [edge, v*, '!v1.*'] (3) 1 Enclose multiple values in a set of square brackets ([]). Separate each value with a comma (,). If a value begins with a symbol (e.g., *), enclose it in single quotation marks (') per YAML rules. 2 A single value doesn’t need to be enclosed in square brackets, but, if it begins with a number (e.g., 2.0), enclose it in single quotation marks ('). If the value begins with a symbol (e.g., *), enclose it in single quotation marks (') per YAML rules. 3 Exact branch names and branch name patterns can be assigned to a branches key. These value patterns are case insensitive. That means the characters are matched regardless of their case. The values can be specified in a comma-separated list or as single items on individual lines. As a general rule of thumb when using YAML, it’s always best to enclose values in single quotation marks. Example 2. branches values listed on individual lines content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-x.git branches: - edge (1) - '2.0' (2) - v* - '!v1.*' (3) 1 Enter each value on its own line with a leading hyphen and blank space. 2 Value that start with number should be enclosed in single quotation marks ('). 3 Negated values, i.e., values that start with the bang symbol (!), should be enclosed single quotation marks ('). When the branches key isn’t set on the content key or a content source, Antora will inherit the default branches filter, [HEAD, v{0..9}*]. That means Antora will use files from the current (for local) or default (for remote) branch (e.g., main) as well as any branch that begins with the letter v followed immediately by a number (e.g., v2.0.x). You can override this inherited value per content source by setting the branches key. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-z.git branches: [rawhide, 90.0, 93.0, dev] (1) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-y.git (2) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-x.git branches: [edge, v*, '!v1.*'] (3) 1 This content source will use the exact branch names specified. 2 This content source will use the default branches filter. 3 This content source will use the edge branch name as well as the branch names that begin with v that are matched by the refname pattern. If you want to modify the default branches filter, assign a value to the branches key directly on the content key. Example 4. Change the default branches filter content: branches: v* (1) sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-z.git (2) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-x.git branches: [edge, v*, '!v1.*'] (3) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-y.git (4) 1 Specify branches under the content key to change the default branches filter. 2 This content source will use the custom default branches filter, i.e., branches: v*. 3 This content source will use the specified branches filter instead of the default one. 4 This content source will also use the custom default branches filter. The new default branches filter will be applied to all of the url entries that don’t have a branches key explicitly defined on them. Branches can be specified by their exact name. content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [main, sneaky-chinchilla, 1.0, 1.5] Antora provides a facility to include and exclude branch names in bulk using pattern matching. For example, branches can be specified using the wildcard operator (*). Example 5. Select branches using a wildcard content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v2.*, v3.*, v4.*] For an in depth look at using wildcards (*), see Wildcards. Antora also supports matching branch names using exclusions, braces, alternation, ranges, and repetition patterns. See Refname Matching in Content Sources. You can unselect branches that were matched by a previous pattern by prefixing the value with !. Here’s how you’d exclude all branches that begin with v and end with -beta: Example 6. Excluding branches using a wildcard content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v*, '!v*-beta'] If the negated pattern appears first in the list, the meaning slightly changes. A negated pattern in this position implies that there’s a * entry before it (e.g., '*', '!main'). Example 7. Include all branches that aren’t excluded by name content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: ['!main'] We recommend against using this inverted selection since it can pull in branches you probably don’t want. It’s best to be specific about the branches you want to match, then use exclusions to reduce that list. When working with a local repository, you may find yourself switching between branches often. To save you from having to remember to update the playbook file to point to the current branch, you can use the reserved value, HEAD. content: sources: - url: ./workspace/project-a branches: HEAD The value HEAD is equivalent to using the name of the current branch.","title":"Branches","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"content-branches","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/content-branches.html","titles":[{"text":"branches key","hash":"branches-key","id":1},{"text":"Default branches filter","hash":"default","id":2},{"text":"Modify the default branches filter","hash":"modify-the-default-branches-filter","id":3},{"text":"Specify branches by name","hash":"exact-name","id":4},{"text":"Specify branches by pattern","hash":"glob-pattern","id":5},{"text":"Exclude branches by pattern","hash":"exclude-branches-by-pattern","id":6},{"text":"Use the current, local branch","hash":"current-local-branch","id":7}]},"178":{"id":178,"text":"On this page, you’ll learn: How Antora builds the edit URL for each page. How to customize the edit URL. How to disable the edit URL. Antora automatically derives an edit URL for all files sourced from the hosted GitLab (gitlab.com), GitHub (github.com), Bitbucket (bitbucket.org), and Pagure (pagure.io) services (SAAS). It does so by first converting the content source URL to a web URL, then using the reference and path information of the current file to construct a URL to the edit mode of that file in the hosted repository. In the default UI, Antora uses this value (if set) to create an Edit this Page link in the upper right corner of each page. That link directs the visitor to the edit interface of that file provided by the hosted git service. For example, if you click the Edit this Page link on this page, your browser will go to GitLab’s file editing interface (on gitlab.com) and load the AsciiDoc source that was used to create this page. One exception is if the repository is private. In this case, the default UI does not show the Edit this Page link. However, you can force the default UI to show the link by setting the FORCE_SHOW_EDIT_PAGE_LINK environment variable (e.g., FORCE_SHOW_EDIT_PAGE_LINK=true) when building the site. Alternately, you can customize the UI template to change the logic. Another exception is if the page originates from the local filesystem (i.e., a worktree). In this case, the default UI uses the local file:// URI for the Edit this Page link. You can force the default UI to always use the edit URL by setting the CI environment variable (e.g., CI=true) when building the site. (This environment variable is already set in most CI environments). The assumption is that if the CI environment variable is set, the site is being published to a remote server where a file:// URI would not be accessible. Rather than setting this environment variable, you can customize the UI template to change the logic. That covers how the edit URL is used. Let’s now look at how you can customize the value. The edit_url key is useful when you’re using an unrecognized git solution, or you want Edit this Page to link to an alternate view, such as the raw or rendered display, of a page’s source file. The edit_url key is set in the playbook and can be applied to all of the content sources or customized per individual source. The key accepts a URL pattern that contains the URL segments of the git solution or source file view plus several placeholder segments, {web_url}, {refname}, {reftype}, {refhash}, and {path}. Antora automatically fulfills these placeholders with the file’s origin information at processing time. Example 1. edit_url key and value edit_url: '{web_url}/blob/{refname}/{path}' (1) 1 Enclose the value of edit_url in single quotation marks (') when it starts with a curly bracket ({). Example 1 shows a hypothetical edit URL pattern containing several placeholders. The word blob is an example of a URL segment that isn’t represented by a placeholder. In the following section, we’ll explain the role of the these placeholders. When edit_url is set, either by default or explicitly, Antora computes the value of the {web_url}, {refname}, {reftype}, {refhash}, and {path} placeholders for each page according to its content source and file origin information. Then, using the pattern assigned to the edit_url key, it assembles each page’s unique edit URL. web_url The {web_url} placeholder is the corresponding web URL for the content source repository that Antora automatically computes from its git URL. For example, https://gitlab.com/cave/sneaky.git is converted to https://gitlab.com/cave/sneaky. This placeholder can be omitted if you use a web URL that differs from the one Antora computes. refname The {refname} is the name of the git reference (e.g., v2.1.x, main, rawhide). reftype The {reftype} is the type of the git reference (i.e., tag or branch). refhash The {refhash} is the commit hash of the git reference (e.g., aab0e5684afe0d4e05955fbef72b6e5538bb1ec5). path The {path} is the path of the source file relative to the root of the repository. It includes the start_path if one is specified. To see an example of the values Antora would compute for the placeholders, we’ll use the content source, branches, and edit URL pattern inputs shown in Example 2. Example 2. edit_url placeholders content: sources: - url: https://app.company.com/the-group/zap.git branches: v1.2.5, next edit_url: '{web_url}/_src/{refname}/u890/{path}' Let’s determine what the edit URL would look like for the page generated from a file named index.adoc. This index.adoc file is stored in branch v1.2.5 of the zap repository in the pages directory of the ROOT module. Using the pattern assigned to edit_url in Example 2, Antora would compute the edit URL shown in Example 3 for index.adoc. Example 3. Edit URL for index.adoc using the inputs from Example 2 https://app.company.com/the-group/zap/_src/v1.2.5/u890/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc Antora replaces {web_url} with the content source’s web URL. In this case, the .git is dropped from the end of the value of url. {refname} is replaced with the v1.2.5 git branch reference. Finally, {path} is replaced by the path to the source file, relative to the root of the repository. Since this source doesn’t have a specified start path, the resulting path is modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc. When a content source has an assigned start_path, Antora prepends it to {path}. Example 4. Content source with start_path and edit_url set content: sources: - url: https://app.company.com/the-group/zap.git branches: v1.2.5, next start_path: learn/docs edit_url: '{web_url}/_src/{refname}/u890/{path}' Using the inputs from Example 4, the edit URL for index.adoc would be: Example 5. Edit URL for index.adoc using the inputs from Example 4 https://app.company.com/the-group/zap/_src/v1.2.5/u890/learn/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc When all or most of your content sources use the same edit_url, you can set it directly on the content key. Example 6. Set edit_url on the content key content: edit_url: '{web_url}/_src/{refname}/u890/{path}' (1) sources: - url: https://app.company.com/the-group/zap.git branches: v1.2.5, next - url: https://app.company.com/city/team-l/zonk.git branches: v2.* 1 When edit_url is set directly on the content key, as it is here, its value is applied to all of the content sources unless the key is reset or disabled on an individual content source. As seen in Example 7, the edit_url key can be set on an individual content source even when it’s set on the content key. Example 7. Set edit_url on the content key and an individual source content: edit_url: '{web_url}/_src/{refname}/u890/{path}' (1) sources: - url: https://app.company.com/the-group/zap.git (2) branches: v1.2.5, next - url: https://git.secretbase.org/ack/boom branches: dev edit_url: '{web_url}/{refname}/ping/0/{path}' (3) - url: https://app.company.com/city/team-l/zonk.git (4) branches: v2.* 1 This edit_url key is set directly on the content key. Its value is applied to all of the content sources unless the key is reset or disabled on an individual content source. 2 This content source will inherit the value of the edit_url key set directly on the content key. 3 When edit_url is set on an individual content source, that value will be used instead of the value assigned to the edit_url key set on the content key. 4 This content source will inherit the value of the edit_url key set directly on the content key. By default, a page’s edit URL links to the file editing interface of the git service where the repository is hosted. This works as long as long as the content source is stored in one of the hosted git services that Antora recognizes, which includes GitLab (gitlab.com), GitHub (github.com), Bitbucket (bitbucket.org), and Pagure (pagure.io). If the repository is not stored in one of these hosted services (e.g., a self-hosted GitLab or Bitbucket instance), you can use the edit_url key to configure how this URL is constructed. For instance, in Example 8, each page’s computed edit URL will now be the URL for GitLab’s rendered file view of the corresponding source file. Example 8. Route the edit URL to an alternate source file view content: edit_url: '{web_url}/blob/{refname}/{path}' (1) sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/cave/sneaky.git branches: v2.0, v1.0 1 The edit_url key is assigned the URL pattern for GitLab’s rendered file view. Using the inputs in Example 8, the Edit this Page link on each page sourced from the https://gitlab.com/cave/sneaky.git repository will link to the rendered view of the corresponding source file on GitLab. To change the link text of Edit this Page or replace it with an image, you’ll need to update your UI. If the repository is private, the default UI will not show the Edit this Page link for the current page, even though the edit URL is defined. However, if the repository is public, and you want to disable the link, or nullify the edit URL for any other reason, you can do so using the playbook. The edit_url key can turn off the edit URL feature on all of your content sources or per individual content source.

The playbook provides several keys to instruct Antora which reference names (i.e., refnames) to consider, including branches, tags, and worktrees, and which start paths within those references to scan. One way to configure this filter is to list each refname individually. However, since content often moves very quickly, that approach can be burdensome and static. That’s why Antora provides a facility to include and exclude refnames in bulk using pattern matching. The pattern matching approach has the benefit of simplifying the configuration and automatically discovering new refnames as they become available. This page describes the value types and syntax you can use for matching refnames in a content source. The keys covered on this page accept two kinds of values: a string (i.e., a character sequence) an array of strings A string value will be split a commas, preferably followed by space, if present. For example, the string v1.0.x, v2.0.x will become an array of two strings, v1.0.x and v2.0.x. It’s usually best to enclose the string values in single quotes to avoid conflicts between characters in the value and special syntax in YAML (or your chosen configuration language). If you’re matching refnames using patterns, we strongly encourage you to use the array syntax. The single or comma-separated string syntax is intended to be used for exact matching only. Otherwise, you might get unexpected behavior. The simplest approach to matching refnames is to specify them as exact names. For example, you can match a single branch named main as follows: branches: main If you want to also add branch names for older release lines, you can separate them by commas: branches: v1.0.x, v2.0.x, main You can also express the value as an array to make it explicit: branches: [v1.0.x, v2.0.x, main] When we say “exact match”, we’re referring to a match against the shortname of the reference. You aren’t matching remotes/origin/v1.0.x or heads/v1.0.x, for instance, but rather v1.0.x. The reason for this is that Antora looks for both remote and local references, preferring the local references, and only selects one per unique shortname. While it appears that the exact match is a literal value, it is, in fact, a pattern. And a pattern always matches from the beginning to the end of the refname. However, most refnames don’t contain any characters which have meaning in the pattern matching syntax (not even .). So it acts like a literal value that looks for a refname that matches exactly. But keep the fact that it’s a pattern in the back of your mind if you find that it is not matching the refname you expect it to match. Having to maintain a list of exact refnames in your playbook can be tedious and noisy. That’s why Antora allows you to match refnames in bulk using pattern matching. The most basic pattern matching tool is the wildcard (*). The use of this pattern is often referred to as globbing, since you use it to capture a glob of items. You can glob all refnames that exist using a lone wildcard: branches: '*' But it’s rare that you’ll want to do that. Let’s say, instead, that we want to match all refnames that start with v. We can do that by placing an asterisk after the letter. branches: v* The * means “any number of characters”. In this case, it matches any number of characters the follow a v at the start of the rename. You can also use the wildcard between two parts of a string to match any number of characters between the two parts. Let’s use it to match version numbers more precisely. branches: v*.*.x This pattern will match v1.0.x, v2.0.x, and even v20.10.x. However, it will only match numbers if the refnames themselves only have number. That means it could also match very.last.x. While we’ll be able to address that problem later when we get into more advanced patterns, it does bring us to the problem of overmatching and the need for exclusions. So far we’ve talked about refnames we want to match, or inclusions. When you start using patterns, you can run into the problem of matching too many items. You can take away from previously matched items using one or more exclusion. An exclusion entry always begins with !. Let’s say you want to match all version-like refnames, but you want to exclude the version before you started using Antora. branches: [v*.*.x, '!v1.0.x'] Notice that we’ve switched the value to the array syntax, as recommended. It’s also necessary to enclose an exclusion entry in single quotes so it does not confuse the YAML parser. When in doubt, enclose string values in single quotes. It never hurts to do it. Let’s throw away that non-version refname that we inadvertently matched: branches: [v*.*.x, '!v1.0.x', '!very.last.x'] You can also use wildcards in the exclusion pattern to bulk match what you’ve already matched and remove those matches. branches: [v*.*.x, '!v1.*.x', '!very.last.x'] The wildcard is a useful tool, but it’s very loose with what characters it matches. You may find that you need to get more precise. That’s where braces come in. Braces, also known as brace expressions, are patterns enclosed in curly braces ({}). There are three kinds of brace expressions supported in Antora: a comma-separated list of alternate character sequences an alpha or numeric range a numeric range with a step A comma-separated list of alternate characters, such as {this,that} should be read as “this or that”. This can be useful for matching specific numbers in a version. Let’s assume that we only want to match a very limited number of major version refnames. We can identify them using an alternation brace expression: branches: v{5,6}.*.x This expression will match v5.0.x, v5.1.x, and v6.0.x. You can use an alternation expression to match the absence of a character or segment using an empty entry. Let’s consider of making the v prefix optional. branches: '{,v}{5,6}.*.x' You can also use wildcards in the alternation entry. For example, we might want to match prereleases this way: branches: '{,v}{5,6}.*.x{,-*}' Let’s consider another case of matching specific minor versions for a given major version refname: branches: v5.{7,8}.x It’s also possible to match refnames that do not start with a v (or other leading character). branches: 5.{7,8}.x As you can imagine, if you’re specifying a bunch of numbers, they may start to form a range. You can consolidate the alternation using the range syntax. If the characters you are matching are members of a range, you can specify them using the start and end values only and separating them with two periods (..). A range is another kind of alternation in which each item is considered. Let’s revisit our version pattern so it only considers matches that have numbers. branches: v{1..9}.{0..9}.x Now we will no longer match very.last.x. However, it will no longer match v20.10.x either. We can fix that by expanding the range, which is not limited to single-digit numbers. branches: v{1..99}.{0..99}.x However, there are more efficient ways of writing this, which we’ll get into in the extended globbing section. Returning to our other example, let’s say that 5.9.x was just released and we want to add it to our Antora-era version number pattern. We can switch from a basic alternation to a range. branches: 5.{7..9}.x Alternately, we could use an exclusion to express this match the opposite way. branches: ['5.*.x', '!5.{0..6}.x'] By default, a range considers each item. You can skip over items using steps. You can adjust the step size of a range by appending a third parameter, offset by two periods. The step size tells the pattern matcher how far to go when moving to the next item in the range. You can match all even major versions from 2 to 8 using the following pattern: branches: v{2..8..2}.*.x By changing the beginning value, you can match odd major versions instead: branches: v{1..9..2}.*.x On their own, braces have limited ability to express complex patterns. To make brace expressions truly powerful, you need to combine them with extended globbing. So far we’ve been matching single occurrences of segments, whether they’re character sequences, alternations, or ranges. We can take our patterns further by specifying how many times these segments must occur, if at all. An extended glob allows you to enclose a pattern or pattern list inside a pair of round brackets, then assign a repetition operator to it. The pattern matching in Antora supports the following operators: * - zero or more times + - one or more times (i.e., at least once) ? - zero or one time (i.e., optional) @ - exactly once (implied if no operator is specified) ! - must not be present The following extended glob is a more formal way of writing {0..9}: @({0..9}) Here’s an extended glob that matches any sequence of numbers. *({0..9}) This use of repetition is far more efficient than the following range, which you should avoid using: {0..100} While you can put * after the pattern list, we don’t recommend it. Repetition operations should always be placed before the pattern list. We can use extended globbing make our version matcher precise in matching all minor versions refnames, beginning with v1.0.0: branches: v@({1..9})*({0..9}).+({0..9}).x or, to be more concise: branches: v{1..9}*({0..9}).+({0..9}).x We’re saying that the major version must not start with 0. Then, it can be followed by any number of digits (e.g., 1, 10, etc.). The minor version can have one or more digits (e.g., 0, 99, 101, etc.). We can use the negation operator to exclude while we’re including instead of using a separate exclusion entry: branches: 5.!({0..5}).x Brace expressions can be nested in order to specify two branches of matching. Here’s how we can exclude those early minor versions while still matching any still to come. branches: '5.{{6..9},{1..9}+({0..9})}.x' We want to caution against making your pattern too complex. While it may be possible to craft a pattern that can do all the matching you need to do, it becomes increasingly harder to read and maintain. That’s why we encourage you to use as many inclusion and exclusion patterns as you need to comfortably match the refnames for your site. Let’s wrap up with a full example of matching a very specific range of version numbers with all milestone versions removed. tags: - '{5,6}.+({0..9}).+({0..9}){,-*}' - '!5.{0..5}.*' - '!*-M+({0..9})'","title":"Refname Matching in Content Sources","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"content-refname-matching","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/content-refname-matching.html","titles":[{"text":"Value types","hash":"value-types","id":1},{"text":"Exact match","hash":"exact-match","id":2},{"text":"Wildcards (basic globbing)","hash":"wildcards","id":3},{"text":"Exclusions","hash":"exclusions","id":4},{"text":"Braces","hash":"braces","id":5},{"text":"Alternation","hash":"alternation","id":6},{"text":"Range","hash":"range","id":7},{"text":"Steps","hash":"steps","id":8},{"text":"Extended globbing and repetition","hash":"extended","id":9}]},"180":{"id":180,"text":"The start_path key identifies where the antora.yml file is located in a repository or local worktree relative to the root of the repository.

When antora.yml is stored at the root of a content source repository, you don’t need to set the start_path key for the url you’re configuring.

What patterns the start_paths key supports for matching directories. How to exclude directories matched by previous patterns. The start_paths key allows you to specify multiple content source roots for a single reference of a repository. In other words, you can put multiple component versions, components, or distributed components—​each having its own antora.yml file—​in a single branch of a repository, then refer to all those content source roots using the same content source entry. When you organize content this way, this feature has the potential of drastically reducing the verbosity of the content sources in your playbook. The start_path key only lets you specify a single path in your playbook for a given content source. In contrast, the start_paths key lets you specify multiple paths. The multiple paths can be even further consolidated using wildcards, exclusions, braces, alternation, ranges, and repetition patterns. Antora will resolve the patterns to one or more fixed paths. The start_paths key is mutually exclusive with the start_path key. If both the start_path and start_paths keys are present on a content source, only the start_paths key is used. Like with the singular start path, the start paths are searched per git reference (i.e., branches, tags, and worktrees). That means a component version descriptor must be found at each start path for each reference. Typically, when using multiple start paths, you’ll only be using a single reference anyway (e.g., main). If you do use multiple references in this scenario, the assumption is that each reference shares the same layout. Multiple start paths are designed primarily to accommodate two use cases: Documentation that’s versioned using folders instead of branches. Documentation for multiple products in a single repository branch (e.g., a monorepo). You can use start_paths to store all versions of a component in a single repository branch using folders instead of using multiple branches. Although you may miss out on some advantages of the version control system, this arrangement can make it easier on writers who are frequently updating multiple versions of the documentation at once. In this scenario, you’d provide a single value for the branches key and use the start_paths key to tell Antora which directories in the branch to use as content roots. If the version folders are named consistently, it becomes easy to match them using a pattern. Here’s an example of a repository layout that uses folders to store documentation versions: 📒 repository 📂 docs 📂 v1.0 📄 antora.yml 📂 v1.1 📄 antora.yml 📂 v2.0 📄 antora.yml You can take it a step further and store all components in a single repository branch using folders instead of using multiple repositories. If those components have versions, you’d likely use subfolders to store the versions as well. This arrangement works best if all the documentation is maintained by the same team or individual and the distributed nature of git just gets in the way. It might also be used for a monorepo, in which the source code for multiple products is stored in the same repository. Antora can discover the documentation wherever it starts within that structure. In this scenario, you’d again provide a single value for the branches key and use the start_paths key to tell Antora which directories in the branch to use as content roots. Only this time, the content source roots will match different components (and possibly versions), not just versions of a single component. Here’s an example of a repository layout that uses folders to store components: 📒 repository 📂 product-a 📂 docs 📄 antora.yml 📂 product-b 📂 docs 📄 antora.yml 📂 product-c 📂 docs 📄 antora.yml Naturally, the repository may have many other files and folders that do not pertain to the documentation. If you only have a couple of paths to register, you might find that using exact path patterns is suitable. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://github.com/org/repo1 start_paths: docs (1) - url: https://github.com/org/repo2 start_paths: docs, more-docs (2) - url: https://github.com/org/repo3 start_paths: [docs, more-docs] (3) - url: https://github.com/org/repo4 start_paths: - docs (4) - more-docs 1 A single path (which is equivalent to using start_path). 2 A comma-separated list of exact path values. 3 An array on a single line, delimited by square brackets ([]). 4 An array on multiple lines, each delimited by a leading -. Along with the methods described in Exact paths, you can use many (but not all) basic and advanced path globbing features to implement pattern matching. A diverse combination of wildcards, braces, and negated patterns are supported. Antora uses these glob patterns to resolve exact paths from which to read the content. The following restrictions apply to how Antora implements path globbing against the full range of supported basic and advanced globbing rules: Wildcards in expressions only match directories, not files. For example, an expression like product-a/docs/*/index.adoc is not supported. Brace expressions must have at least two entries, even if a wildcard is present. For example, docs/product-{a*,b} is recognized as a brace expression, but not docs/product-{a*}. Single brace expressions that match multiple characters do not work when following a segment that contains a wildcard. For example, */v{0..99} matches the start path product-a/v2 but not product-a/v99. Instead, use a repetition operation, such as */v({0..9})`, or a nested brace expression for each length permutation, such as `*/v{{1..9},{1..9}{0..9}}+. Double globstar patterns such as **/docs are not supported. A glob matches a single level in the hierarchy. Wildcard matching reduces the number of values you need to assign to a start_paths key. For instance, if you have multiple components stored in a branch, you could list them all in a comma-separated list like the one shown in Example 2. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://github.com/org/repo1 branches: main start_paths: docs/product-a, docs/product-b, docs/product-c Or, as shown in Example 3, you could use a wildcard segment and reduce the number of values you need to declare. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://github.com/org/repo1 branches: main start_paths: docs/product-* Wildcard matching offers the possibility of registering new content source roots as you add them, providing you keep the pattern consistent. Brace expressions can specify an explicit list of items separated by commas to expand (docs/product-{a,b,c,f}) or a range of items to expand (docs/product-{a..f}). A brace expression may not consist of only a single item, even if that item contains a wildcard (e.g., docs/product-{a} and docs/product-{a*} are not brace expressions). Brace expressions may be nested (e.g., docs-*/v{{1..9},{1..9}{0..9} matches the subfolders v1 through v99 of root folders that match the name docs-*). In this case, each permutation for each nested brace expression is tested. When you use braces in a start_paths value, all entries within the braces must exist when expanded (unless the segment is preceded by a wildcard segment). If you specify docs/product-{a,b} as a start_paths value, the following paths must be present within the repository: docs/product-a docs/product-b You can use a prefix in your file path before a brace expression to simplify what Antora checks for in the expression. Example 4. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://github.com/org/repo1 branches: main start_paths: docs/v{1..9} You can also use wildcards in brace expressions to help expand values. Example 5. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://github.com/org/repo1 branches: main start_paths: docs/product-v{1*,2*} The start_paths pattern in Example 5 would match the following paths: docs/product-v1.1 docs/product-v1.2 docs/product-v1.2.1 docs/product-v2.0 docs/product-v2.1.1 Use negated patterns to exclude patterns previously matched. This approach is useful if you want to match all directories except for those that match a certain pattern. Example 6. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://github.com/org/repo1 start_paths: - docs/user/* - docs/dev/* - !**/*-beta.* (1) 1 Negated path globbing patterns must follow any path inclusions, and must be declared after locations that have already been matched. Hidden directories (i.e., directories that begin with .) are ignored by default. To include them in a start_paths path globbing pattern, use a .* in the pattern. For example, use docs/.*-{a,b} to include all hidden directories with the suffix of -a or -b. A non-wildcard segment that follows a wildcard segment is considered optional. This exception is intended to simplify directory matching logic. For example, docs/product-*/client would match product-a/client but disregard product-b if it does not contain a client folder. Another valid example would be docs/product/*/client where the * represents different version directories (v1.0, v1.1, etc) of client documentation. If the client folder does not exist in one of the version directories, Antora ignores it from a validation perspective. If the final segment of a file path pattern contains an unmatched brace pattern, Antora treats it as optional from a validation perspective. For example, docs/product-*/{client,b2b} will not fail validation if docs/product-a/b2b is not present.","title":"Multiple Start Paths","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"content-source-start-paths","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/content-source-start-paths.html","titles":[{"text":"start_paths key","hash":"start-paths-key","id":1},{"text":"Relationship to the start_path key","hash":"relationship-to-the-start_path-key","id":2},{"text":"Relationship to git references","hash":"relationship-to-git-references","id":3},{"text":"Use cases","hash":"use-cases","id":4},{"text":"Component versions as folders","hash":"component-versions-as-folders","id":5},{"text":"Components as folders","hash":"components-as-folders","id":6},{"text":"Exact paths","hash":"exact-paths","id":7},{"text":"Path globbing","hash":"path-globbing","id":8},{"text":"Globbing restrictions","hash":"globbing-restrictions","id":9},{"text":"Wildcards","hash":"wildcards","id":10},{"text":"Braces","hash":"braces","id":11},{"text":"Negated globs","hash":"negated-globs","id":12},{"text":"Ignored directories","hash":"ignored-directories","id":13},{"text":"Optional matches","hash":"optional-matches","id":14}]},"182":{"id":182,"text":"The url key tells Antora where to find a content source repository. Antora can connect to public and private git repositories that are defined be a url key in a playbook. At least one url key must be specified under the sources key. You can add as many url keys as you need. Each url key tells Antora where to find a git repository that contains content source files. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo.git - url: /absolute/path/to/local-repo The url key accepts any URI that git supports, including a local filesystem path. Like with git, Antora differentiates between a local filesystem path and a remote URI based on certain characters in the value. If the value matches either of the two rules listed below, the value will always be handled as a remote URI, not a local filesystem path. The value contains a colon that’s not followed by a forward slash or backslash (host:repo). The value contains a colon that’s followed by two forward slashes (://). All remote content repositories must be accessible via a URL (a web address that’s fetched using either the basic or encrypted HTTP protocol) (i.e., http:// or https://). The repository location can be expressed using a URL, an SSH URI, or a git URI. Internally, that location is always converted to a URL. content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-z.git - url: git@git-service.com:org/repo-y.git - url: git://git-service.com/org/repo-x.git Whether the .git extension is required depends on the settings of the git host. It’s not needed for repositories hosted on GitHub, required for repositories hosted on GitLab, and forbidden for repositories hosted on Team Foundation Server (TFS) or Azure DevOps, to cite a few scenarios (and to exhibit the nature of the problem). That’s why the ensure_git_suffix key is provided for you, which is enabled by default. Antora can connect to private git repositories as long as a supported authentication method is specified for the private content source repositories. Antora permits the value of url to be a relative or absolute filesystem path to a local repository that has at least one commit. content: sources: - url: /absolute/path/to/local-repo (1) - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-z.git - url: ./another-local-repo (2) 1 Absolute path to git repository 2 Relative path to git repository (starting from the directory of the playbook) In order to use a local content repository with Antora, even when using the worktree (HEAD), the repository must have at least one commit. If you’re not ready to commit any files, you can initialize a repository and create an empty commit (e.g., git init . && git commit --allow-empty -m init). A relative path is expanded to an absolute path using the following rules: If the first path segment is a tilde (~), the remaining path is resolved relative to the user’s home directory. If the first path segment is a dot (.), the remaining path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file. If the first path segment is a tilde directly followed by a plus sign (~+), or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the remaining path is resolved relative to the current working directory. When the URL for a content source is a local repository (which must have at least one commit), and the branches filter matches the branch that’s currently checked out (aka the worktree branch), Antora reads files from the worktree (i.e., the working directory on the local filesystem) instead of from the git index. This behavior is central to the author mode in Antora. It means you don’t have to commit files locally before Antora can use them. Example 2. Use files from the worktree content: sources: - url: ./demo-component-b branches: main - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: v1.0, v2.0 Instead of specifying the name of the current branch explicitly, you can use the symbolic name HEAD as an alias for the current branch name. This saves you the trouble of having to update your playbook when you switch branches. Example 3. Use files from the worktree content: sources: - url: ./demo-component-b branches: HEAD - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: v1.0, v2.0 If the branches filter matches both the worktree branch and another branch that contains the same files for the same component version, Antora will fail to run because it does not permit duplicate files. To ensure Antora doesn’t use files from the worktree, even if the branch filter matches the worktree branch, you can point the URL directly at the .git directory. This effectively hides the worktree from Antora so it won’t get used. Example 4. Refers directly at the .git folder to bypass files in the worktree content: sources: - url: ./demo-component-b/.git branches: HEAD - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: v1.0, v2.0 A better way to bypass the git worktree is to set the worktrees key to false. Example 5. Sets worktrees to false to bypass files in the worktree content: sources: - url: ./demo-component-b branches: HEAD worktrees: false - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: v1.0, v2.0 Keep in mind that, in this case, all files must be committed locally in order for Antora to use them.","title":"URLs for Content Sources","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"content-source-url","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/content-source-url.html","titles":[{"text":"url key","hash":"url-key","id":1},{"text":"Use remote content repositories","hash":"remote-urls","id":2},{"text":"Use local content repositories","hash":"local-urls","id":3},{"text":"Use the git worktree","hash":"git-worktree","id":4},{"text":"Bypassing the git worktree","hash":"bypassing-the-git-worktree","id":5}]},"183":{"id":183,"text":"The version key provides a way to control the component version that corresponds to a content source directly from the playbook. The version key on the content source is a fallback value. If a component version descriptor (an antora.yml file) defines the version key for a component version, the value of that key takes precedence. The version key is optional. The version key accepts a named identifier, such as jesse, a semantic identifier, such as '1.5', the reserved value ~ (for unversioned), the reserved value true, or a map of refname projections, such as v/(?*): $. A content source can match multiple git references. Thus, a fixed value should only be used if the content source is configured to match a single reference, or if all the references it matches contribute files to the same component version. Otherwise, the value of this key should be true or a map of refname projections. If you want the playbook to be able to control the value of the version key, don’t set the version key in the component version descriptor (antora.yml file). The following example shows how to assign a fixed fallback value to the version key. A fixed value can be a named identifier, a semantic identifier, or the value ~ for unversioned. Example 1. Content source with a fixed value assigned to version content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-a.git branches: v2.0.x (1) version: '2.0' (2) 1 Only match a single reference when using a fixed value. 2 Assign a fixed value, such as a named identifier, semantic identifier, or the value ~. When Antora looks for the component version descriptor in the specified branch (i.e., v2.0), it will not expect to find the version key defined in that file. Instead, it will use the fixed value of the version key specified on the content source (i.e., 2.0). Since content in Antora is retrieved from a git repository, you may want to use the git refname (branch or tag name) for the content source (where the component version descriptor is stored) as the version. To do so, assign the reserved value true to the version key. Antora will substitute the value true with the refname automatically. The following example shows how to use the refname as the fallback value of the version key. Example 2. Content source that uses the refname as the version content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-b.git branches: v* (1) version: true (2) 1 Match any number of references. 2 The value true tells Antora to use the matched refname as the value. When Antora looks for the component version descriptor in the specified branch (i.e., v2.0), it will not expect to find the version key defined in that file. Instead, it will use the refname instead. The value Antora uses is always the short refname (e.g., v1.0), not the full refname (e.g., refs/heads/v1.0). The refname may not be granular enough to use as the fallback version. Furthermore, the same git tree could be passed through git references that have different naming schemes, such as feature branches. In these cases, you want the version to be extracted or derived from the refname rather than using the value as is. That’s when you’d define the fallback version using a refname projection. A refname projection is expressed as a map of patterns (the keys) and replacements (the values). The refname projection allows you to match the refname using a pattern, then build the version based on that match. The pattern tells Antora which entry to use and what parts to extract from it. The replacement tells Antora how to derive a version from the matched refname. The following example shows how to use a projection to compute the value of the version key from the refname. Example 3. Content source that derives version from refname content: sources: - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-c.git branches: [v*, feature/*] (1) version: v(?+({0..9}).+({0..9})).x: $ (2) feature/(*)/*: $1 (3) 1 Match any number of references with different naming patterns. 2 Matches the semantic identifier in a refname like v2.0.x and extracts it. 3 Extracts the value between the first and second slash for a refname that begins with feature/ The key in the projection is a glob pattern (a combination of extglobs, ranges, and some regex constructs). The pattern has the same matching capabilities as the pattern used to match branches or tags for a content source in the playbook. The characters between parentheses (i.e., round brackets) in the pattern defines a match group. If the opening brace begins with ?, that group is assigned to the name specified between the angle brackets. Otherwise, the group is assigned to a 1-based index according to the group’s position in the pattern. The match groups can be referenced in the replacement. A match group reference is preceded by a dollar sign ($). A named group can be referenced using $, where the name is once again specified between the angle brackets. An indexed group can be referenced by its number, such as $1. You can reference the entire refname using $&. If the match group contains any forward slashes, Antora will replace each one with a hyphen. Antora will use the value of the first pattern it matches. If none of the patterns match the refname, Antora will fallback to using the refname as the version. Antora supports matching refnames using wildcards, exclusions, braces, alternation, ranges, and repetition patterns.

We generally recommend against pulling documentation from tags. If you do use tags, we recommend using dedicated documentation tags rather than reusing tags for software releases.

The tags key is optional and can be specified directly on the content key or on a url key. It accepts a list of tag name patterns. Each value can be an exact tag name (e.g., v2.3.1, v3.9.4, etc.) or a pattern (e.g., v2.*, v@({1..9})*({0..9}).({0..9}).x+, etc.). The list of tags can also be a combination of these value types.

To apply the same tag filter to all the url entries that don’t declare the a tags key explicitly, specify a tags key directly on the content key. Example 2.

This behavior is controlled using the worktrees key. The worktrees key accepts a keyword or a list of exact branch names or glob patterns. Worktrees are only relevant for branches, not tags. The worktrees key is optional. If not specified, Antora will automatically use the main (i.e., primary) worktree of a local repository if the current branch of that repository is among the branches matched by the branches key. If such a match is made, Antora will take the files from the worktree instead of the files from the git tree for that branch. By default, Antora only uses the main worktree (not to be confused with the main branch), not linked worktrees. To customize this behavior, you can set the worktrees key. The main worktree is not necessarily linked to the main branch, but rather to the current branch of the local repository. The worktrees key is specified on the entry for a content source. The key accepts a keyword or a list of branch name patterns. Each branch name pattern can either be an exact branch name or a positive or negative glob pattern. To enable the use of all worktrees, simply set the worktrees key to the keyword value true. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml content: sources: - url: /path/to/repo-a/main branches: [v1.0, v2.0, main] worktrees: true In order for Antora to discover linked worktrees, the url key must point to the location of the main worktree (where the .git folder is located). If the url points directly to a linked worktree, Antora will not recognize it as a valid git repository. It’s possible to get Antora to support using a linked worktree as a content source with the help of an extension. The following Antora extension will detect when the url key of a content source points to a linked worktree, then reconfigure the content source to point to the main worktree instead.

These environment variable can be used to configure Antora for different environments without having to modify the playbook file. An environment variable is a persistent variable (i.e., key=value pair) in your terminal which becomes available to all commands you execute at the prompt. This facility allows the behavior of commands to be altered based on which environment they are running in. For example, you may use an environment variable in a continuous integration (CI) or publishing environment to enable a behavior which may not be enabled by default. You can output the current value of an environment variable using the echo command. In a Linux or macOS terminal, type: $ echo $PATH In the Windows command prompt, type: $ echo %PATH% And in Windows Powershell, type: $ echo $env:PATH Environment variables are not required for using Antora. You can configure these variables using the corresponding command line options or in your playbook with the matching keys. Environment variables take precedence over keys defined in the playbook file. However, the CLI option for a key takes precedence over the environment variable for that key. If an environment variable (such as URL or https_proxy) is already set in your environment, and you wish to unset it temporarily when you run the antora command (i.e., a single invocation), you can do so using the env command: $ env -u URL antora antora-playbook.yml Another option is to run the antora command in a subshell. Inside a subshell, you can unset an environment variable without it affecting the environment of your main shell or operating system. $ (unset URL; antora antora-playbook.yml) Remember that environment variables take precedence over keys defined in your playbook file.

By default, Antora will look for these authentication credentials in the default git credentials store. When you’re using an alternate git credential store location or haven’t populated the default store with credentials, you can use the credentials.path or credentials.contents keys to pass your credentials to Antora. When a git host requests authentication for a private content source repository, Antora’s built-in credential manager automatically checks for credentials in the default git credential store. The default path for the git credential store is $HOME/.git-credentials (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials, if the previous location doesn’t exist). The credentials key is set under the git key. Example 1. antora-playbook.adoc git: (1) credentials: (2) 1 Enter the parent key git, followed by a colon (:), and then press Enter. 2 The credentials key is a child of git. Enter the key’s name, credentials, followed by a colon (:), and then press Enter. The credentials key accepts a key-value pair that specifies an alternate filesystem path (path) to a git credentials file or the contents of the git credentials file (contents). The contents key and the path key are mutually exclusive. That is, you can only set one or the other in your playbook. Instead of using the credential store at the default path, you can instruct Antora to look for the file in a different location. The path key specifies a filesystem path where Antora can locate the git credential store. This path is configured under the git and credentials keys in a playbook. The path key accepts an absolute filesystem path or a filesystem path relative to the playbook file. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml git: credentials: (1) path: /home/user/.git-credentials (2) 1 The path key is nested under credentials 2 Type the key name path, followed by a colon (:). After the colon, enter a blank space, and then the filesystem path to the git credential store. You can also specify an alternate git credentials path using the --git-credentials-path CLI option or GIT_CREDENTIALS_PATH environment variable. Instead of using the contents key, we highly recommend populating the default credential store with your credentials or passing them using the GIT_CREDENTIALS environment variable. This key is really only intended for an auto-generated playbook file. The contents key accepts one set of credentials or the credentials for one git host using the contents key. To specify more than one set of credentials or access private repositories on different git hosts, you need to populate the credential store interactively or directly. You can also pass more than one set of credentials using the GIT_CREDENTIALS environment variable. The contents key is configured under the git.credentials key in a playbook. The value of contents depends on the git host that serves the private content sources repository. In general, the value takes the form of https://@, where is a placeholder that references an environment variable ($ENV_VARIABLE), a username/password pair (username:password), or an access token (token). is the address of the git server (e.g., gitlab.com). We don’t recommend directly entering your git host username/password pair or access token into a playbook! You could accidentally expose them by pushing your playbook to a remote repository or CI server. In the example below, a reference to an environment variable named GITHUB_TOKEN is placed where the host GitHub expects to locate an access token. The credentials structure and location depends on the git host. For instance, GitHub requires a colon (:) be placed at the end of the token. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml git: credentials: contents: https://$GITHUB_TOKEN:@github.com Unfortunately, Antora does not yet support resolving environment variables located in the playbook file. However, you can emulate this behavior by using the following script to substitute the environment variable reference with a value prior to invoking Antora: $ sed -i s/\\$GITHUB_TOKEN/$GITHUB_TOKEN/ antora-playbook.yml && antora antora-playbook.yml Despite this workaround, we still recommend populating the git credential store or passing your credentials using the GIT_CREDENTIALS environment variable instead of using the contents key.","title":"Git Credentials Path and Contents","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"git-credentials-path-and-contents","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/git-credentials-path-and-contents.html","titles":[{"text":"Default git credentials store and path","hash":"default","id":1},{"text":"credentials key","hash":"credentials-key","id":2},{"text":"path key","hash":"path-key","id":3},{"text":"contents key","hash":"contents-key","id":4}]},"188":{"id":188,"text":"The fetch_concurrency key tells Antora how many concurrent fetch operations to allow when retrieving content from remote git repositories. This covers both the fetch and clone operations (since clone first does a fetch). When the number of concurrent operations reaches this limit, Antora will wait for an active operation to complete before adding another one to queue. See the Git Read Concurrency Limit to learn how to control how many repositories Antora reads from at once. By default, Antora limits the fetch concurrency to 1, which means it will only fetch from one repository at a time. If you want to allow Antora to fetch all the repositories at once, you can change this value to 0. Fetching a lot of repositories at once can put a heavy burden on the network. Additionally, some git hosting services place a quota on concurrent requests, especially anonymous onces (called rate limiting). That may lead to the git client being throttled (or even barred) by the git server. In the worst case, the server may hang up on the network connection, which will cause Antora to fail. To alleviate this situation, Antora allows you to tune the fetch concurrency limit. The optional fetch_concurrency key is set under the git category in the playbook. This key accepts a positive integer value or 0 for no limit. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml git: fetch_concurrency: 5 The purpose of the fetch_concurrency key is to allow you to control (i.e., limit) how many network connections are being made at once by the content aggregator, thus circumventing the problem of rate limiting enforced by the git host. If the git server is extremely aggressive with resetting paused connections, such as the case with GitHub, you’re advised to set this value to 1. You may find that by limiting the number of concurrent operations, it reduces the time it takes the fetch operations to complete. Presumably, this is because the git server does not throttle the requests. However, fetching repositories in serial could also increase the amount of time it takes to fetch the repositories in total. You will need to experiment with this value to find the setting that works best for your site. For interactive terminals, limiting the fetch concurrency also limits the number of progress bars that appear at once in the terminal. Once a repository is fetched, or if a fetch is not required, Antora puts the repository into a pool to be scanned. By default, Antora does not place a limit on how many repositories are scanned concurrently. You can control this behavior using the Git Read Concurrency Limit key. Antora only starts reading from repositories once all fetch (or clone) operations are complete. The limit is only applied to the fetch step.

The credential manager plugin is called each time the git client interacts with a repository that requires authentication.

It provides a way to specify a custom HTTP request handler for the git client to use.

This key effectively controls how many git indexes are loaded into memory at once (a git index is the backing storage for files in a git repository). Antora only reads repositories once all fetch/clone operations on those repositories are complete. Thus, the fetch and read are separate steps. By default, Antora does not limit the read concurrency (value 0), which means it will load all repositories into memory at once when scanning for and collecting files. Loading a lot of large repositories at once can consume a lot of memory. To alleviate this situation, Antora allows you to tune the read concurrency limit. The read concurrency does not impact the fetch concurrency or the network traffic. The optional read_concurrency key is set under the git category in the playbook. This key accepts a positive integer value or 0 for no limit. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml git: read_concurrency: 4 When working with a lot of repositories, an optimal value is somewhere between 2 and 5. The purpose of the read_concurrency key is to allow you to control how much memory is consumed when reading files from the content repositories. Once a git index is loaded into memory, Antora uses unlimited concurrency to read the tree of each reference to collect files into the precursor of the content catalog (creating the content catalog is a subsequent step). While the residual memory will equate to the size of all content files collected, the git index that contains those files could be substantially larger. This is especially true when the documentation is co-located with the source files of a software project. Antora has to load the git index even if it is only taking a fraction of the files. You may find that by limiting the number of concurrent operations, it reduces the time it takes the content aggregator to complete. This is presumably because Antora has to do less context switching.

Where the playbook file is located. The playbook file formats Antora accepts. An Antora playbook makes it easy for technical writers to control what content is included in your site, what user interface (UI) is applied to it, and where the site is published using a playbook file. The settings in the playbook file, in combination with CLI options and environment variables, tell Antora how to operate. Specifically, a playbook tells Antora: What information should be applied to the site globally, such as its title and URL. The page that sits at the root of the site (i.e., home or landing page content). Which content repositories, branches, and tags to feed into Antora. What AsciiDoc attributes and Asciidoctor extensions should be applied site wide. Which UI bundle to use to control the visual layout, style, and behavior of the pages. Where the site should be published and in what output format. How and when Antora should handle source repository updates, artifact updates, and its cache. Additionally, certain settings in the playbook file can be overridden using CLI options or environment variables, which allows an operations team to tailor the behavior for specific environments, such as production. A playbook is usually located in a playbook project. A playbook project repository is responsible for generating a documentation site. It’s strictly a configuration as code repository—​it does not contain any content. Instead, it contains a playbook file, and, in certain situations, supplemental UI files and extension code. Playbooks can be written in YAML, JSON, and TOML. YAML is a common configuration language for defining automated tasks and most of the playbook examples in this documentation use YAML. But you’re free to use any of these formats. Regardless of its format, a playbook contains structured key-value pairs for specifying general site properties, content and UI input sources, and published output destinations and providers. By default, Antora resolves relative paths in the playbook from the current working directory. For example, the path public is effectively $PWD/public. If, instead, you want Antora to resolve relative paths from the directory where the playbook file is located, prepend ./ to the path (e.g., ./public). By starting relative paths with ./, you make your playbook more portable. It means you can run the antora command from any directory on the filesystem and the behavior will be the same. If you don’t start relative paths with ./, the path Antora resolves is dependent on the current working directory. To get portable behavior, you have to switch to the directory where the playbook file is located before running the antora command. Only use bare relative paths if you intend the path to be tied to the current working directory.","title":"The Antora Playbook","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"index","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s an Antora playbook?","hash":"whats-an-antora-playbook","id":1},{"text":"Where is a playbook stored?","hash":"where-is-a-playbook-stored","id":2},{"text":"Playbook file formats","hash":"playbook-file-formats","id":3},{"text":"Relative paths in a playbook","hash":"relative-paths-in-a-playbook","id":4}]},"193":{"id":193,"text":"The purpose of network proxy-related keys in the playbook is to allow Antora to be used behind an HTTP/HTTPS proxy, such as in a typical corporate environment. The requests these keys impact, at present, include those made by the git client in the content aggregator and the HTTP client in the UI loader. By default, Antora respects the industry-standard http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy environment variables, if set. That means Antora may automatically proxy network requests, even if these keys are not set in the playbook file. This reflects a noteworthy change in behavior from Antora 2. The http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables specify a URL through which Antora should route HTTP and HTTP requests, respectively. The no_proxy environment variable allows for requests to certain domains or subdomains to bypass the proxy (i.e., exclusions). It’s not possible to configure different proxies for different URLs using this approach. The only URL-specific configuration is to disable the proxy for certain domains or subdomains using no_proxy. By honoring these environment variables, Antora is fulfilling the standard contract in network programming for working with proxies without having to modify the settings at the application level. This is the contract by which network-based software is developed. If the connection still cannot be made when these environment variables are set, it’s an IT issue. If it’s necessary to configure the proxy settings without the use of environment variables, then, and only then, do you need to specify them in the playbook file. If that’s the case, read on. The http_proxy key accepts a URL through which to route HTTP requests. The URL should only contain the protocol (http or https), domain (root domain or subdomain), and a port. When set, all HTTP requests made by Antora will be routed through this URL. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml network: http_proxy: http://localhost:3128 The protocol of the proxy URL does not have to match the protocol of the original URL. The https_proxy key accepts a URL through which to route HTTPS requests. The URL should only contain the protocol (http or https), domain (root domain or subdomain), and a port. When set, all HTTPS requests made by Antora will be routed through this URL. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml network: https_proxy: http://localhost:3128 The protocol of the proxy URL does not have to match the protocol of the original URL. The no_proxy key specifies proxy exclusions. These exclusions are expressed as a comma-separated list of domains or subdomains. If the URL of a request matches one of these values, it will not be routed through the proxy, even if a proxy is configured for the protocol of the URL (http or https). Example 3. antora-playbook.yml network: no_proxy: gitlab.com,github.com To turn off the proxy for all requests, set this value to *. Example 4. antora-playbook.yml network: no_proxy: '*' Antora 2 didn’t honor the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables. If you’re migrating from Antora 2 to Antora 3, and you encounter a network error (Bad response: 503), the automatic proxy support in Antora 3 may be the culprit. If the proxy is standing in the way of Antora connecting to an endpoint, you may need to bypass the proxy using the no_proxy key. If you want to avoid modifying your playbook, you can specify this key using a CLI option: $ antora --noproxy '*' antora-playbook.yml However, if this is necessary, you may want to understand why the proxy is failing to route the request.","title":"Network Proxy","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"network-proxy","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/network-proxy.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic configuration","hash":"automatic-configuration","id":1},{"text":"http_proxy key","hash":"http-proxy","id":2},{"text":"https_proxy key","hash":"https-proxy","id":3},{"text":"no_proxy key","hash":"no-proxy","id":4}]},"194":{"id":194,"text":"The dir key specifies the directory where the generated site files are published.

These credentials can be externalized so they don’t have to be hard-coded into the playbook. This page covers various ways you can pass the credentials to Antora, including the built-in git credential store, a custom credential store, and even your own credential manager. Let’s start by looking at the authentication credential types Antora accepts by default, then move on to how to set them up and put them to use. Antora can authenticate with private repositories using HTTP Basic authentication. HTTP Basic authentication requires sending credentials to the server (over HTTPS) to verify your identity. Authentication credentials consist of either a username/password pair or an access (OAuth 2.0) token. The username/password pair is usually what you use to log in to the service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) where the repository is hosted. If the username or password contains characters which have special meaning in a URL, such as /, #, and :, these characters must be URL encoded (i.e., percent encoded) so they aren’t misinterpreted by the URL parser. Keep in mind that while some git hosts support this means of authentication, others do not. You may have better luck using an access token. When two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on your account, you can’t use the username/password pair to authenticate with a private repository. You’ll receive the error 401 HTTP Basic: Access Denied when you try. Regardless of the reason, if the git host does not allow you to authenticate using a username/password pair, you’ll need to use an access token instead. There are two types of access tokens: personal access tokens and deploy tokens. A personal access token is bound to the user and grants access to any private repository that your account can access (subject to the scope settings of the token itself). A deploy token (not a deploy key) is bound to the project (i.e., repository) and grants access to a single repository (subject to the scope settings on the token itself). Deploy keys cannot be used with Antora since they require the use of SSH authentication, which the git client in Antora does not support. You typically use a single personal access token on your own machine and one or more deploy tokens on a CI server. To create an access token for GitHub, see Creating a personal access token (PAT) for the command line. GitHub has two types of access tokens, fine-grained and classic. Both are supported by Antora, though the fine-grained token must be granted the Contents permission to the repositories you want to use. GitHub also supports Installation Access Tokens (IAT), which are bound to an application instead of user. These access tokens are more suitable for use in an organization. GitHub does not support deploy tokens at this time. To learn more about how to create access tokens for use with GitHub, refer to the articles Antora with GitHub PAT and Antora with GitHub IAT. To create an access token for GitLab, see Personal Access Tokens and Deploy Tokens. For Bitbucket, you’ll need to create an app password with read access to repositories. An app password is a user-based access token. Now let’s see how to supply these credentials to Antora’s built-in credential manager via the default git credential store. By default, Antora’s built-in credential manager automatically checks for credentials in the git credential store (a database file). The default path for the git credential store is $HOME/.git-credentials, or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials if the first location doesn’t exist. Note that this path is a file, not a directory. Since Antora consults the credential manager automatically when credentials are requested by the git host (aka on demand), you don’t have to specify credentials directly in your playbook. In fact, the content sources in your playbook that are private will look just like content sources that are public. Here’s how a private content source in your playbook might look: content: sources: - url: https://hostname/your-org/private-repository When Antora is notified by the git host that a URL requires authentication, it will look for a matching entry in the credentials store. Antora looks for a match using the URL as the key. If a protocol (e.g., https) and hostname (and, optionally, the repository path) are found in the credentials store, those credentials are returned to Antora’s credential manager and passed on to the git server. The credential store contains zero or more line-based entries. If you need to specify multiple credentials for a single hostname (such as multiple deploy tokens), put each entry on its own line. The structure of each entry is as follows: https://@ is either a username/password pair (username:password) or an access token (token:). is the address of the git server (e.g., github.com). If the username or password contains characters which have special meaning in a URL, such as /, #, or :, these characters must be URL encoded. (The @ does not have special meaning in a username or password). It’s usually safe to always URL encode the username and password components in the URL. This requirement only applies for URLs that are defined in the git credential store. To URL encode a component, open the JavaScript console in your browser, and run encodeURIComponent(''), where is the username or password value. Use the printed result in place of your username or password, if different. For example, the URL encoded version of my#password is my%23password. You can populate the credential store interactively using the system git command or by editing the credential store directly. Let’s start with the interactive approach. You can use the git command to populate the credential store interactively. This approach is especially useful since it allows you to verify that your credentials are accepted by the git server. First, select the URL of a private repository you want to use with Antora. Next, in your terminal, run the following command for each private repository you need to access from Antora: $ echo -n 'Repository URL: ' && read REPLY && \\ git -c credential.helper=store ls-remote -h $REPLY > /dev/null This command performs the following steps: Prompts you for the URL of a private repository. Communicates with the private repository, triggering a prompt for your credentials. If you aren’t prompted for your credentials, it means your credentials are already stored. Stores the credentials in the $HOME/.git-credentials file (and assigns it the appropriate permissions). If this script succeeds, you can use the applicable private repositories in Antora without any further configuration. If the interactive approach didn’t work for you, you can populate the credential store directly. Let’s give that a shot. To add credentials to the git credential store directly, create the file (not directory) $HOME/.git-credentials and open it in your editor. Put each unique set of credentials (i.e., username/password pair or access token plus hostname and optional repository path) on its own line. If you’re using a single git host and a personal access token, you only need one entry. If you’re using multiple git hosts or multiple deploy tokens, you’ll need more than one entry. Here’s an example entry that uses a username/password pair: https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com Here’s an example that uses a token (pay attention to the trailing : after the token): https://abcdefg0123456:@github.com To use different credentials for a given repository on the same git host, you can append a repository path (i.e., ) to the entry to make the matching more strict. (The .git file extension in the repository path is optional). https://@/ Here’s an example of an entry for a specific repository path: https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com/octocat/Hello-World Here are examples for several popular git hosts (for which you’d substitute the placeholders in bold with the real values): https://TOKEN:@github.com/org/project-docs https://oauth2:TOKEN@gitlab.com/org/project-docs.git https://gitlab+deploy-token-TOKEN_ID:TOKEN@gitlab.com/org/project-docs.git https://x-oauth-token:TOKEN@bitbucket.org/org/project-docs.git https://USERNAME:APP_PASSWORD@bitbucket.org/org/project-docs.git Specifying the repository path in the URL is optional. If you don’t include it, that credential pair will be used for all URLs that share the same git host. You may need to append the .git file extension depending on which URL format you use for your content sources and whether you’ve configured the ensure_git_suffix key in your playbook. Notice that the tokens are located in different locations in the URL depending on the git host. See OAuth2 formats for more details. If you’re using a Bitbucket app password, notice you must include your own username (using the format USERNAME:APP_PASSWORD). To ensure the credentials file is protected, immediately set its file permissions so it cannot be read by others. $ chmod 600 $HOME/.git-credentials Instead of using the credential store at the default path(s), you can instruct Antora to look for the file in a different location using either the --git-credentials-path CLI option or GIT_CREDENTIALS_PATH environment variable, both of which set the git.credentials.path playbook key at runtime. Here’s an example that uses the CLI option to specify a path relative to the playbook file: $ antora --git-credentials-path=./.git-credentials antora-playbook.yml To learn more about how to use the git.credentials.path playbook key, including how to set it directly in the playbook, consult the reference for the git.credentials.path key. Instead of reading the credentials from a file, you can have Antora read the credentials directly from the environment variable named GIT_CREDENTIALS, which sets the git.credentials.contents playbook key at runtime. Here’s an example that demonstrates the concept: $ export GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com' $ antora antora-playbook.yml You can even reduce this to a single line (which only defines the environment variable for the scope of the command): $ GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com' antora antora-playbook.yml When using the Windows command prompt, you need to define the environment variable using the set command: C:\\> set \"GIT_CREDENTIALS=https://octocat:ilovegit@github.com\" && antora antora-playbook.yml This strategy is most useful in a CI environment where environment variables can be secured. It’s also a quick and informal way of passing credentials to Antora when generating the site on your own machine. When using the environment variable, multiple entries may be separated either by a comma or a newline character. For example: $ GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://my-github-token:@github.com,https://oauth2:my-gitlab-token@gitlab.com' antora antora-playbook.yml Exporting the environment variable saves you from having to type it each time you run Antora. To learn more about how to use the git.credentials.contents playbook key, including how to set it directly in the playbook, consult the reference for the git.credentials.contents key. Another option for passing credentials to the credential manager is to encode them directly in the URL listed in the playbook. Since this option doesn’t trigger the challenge-response workflow, Antora automatically assumes the repository is private. This strategy is not recommended unless you’re using a placeholder to inject the real credentials, as described at the end of this section. Antora will extract the credentials that precede the hostname (i.e., username:password@ or token@) and use them to perform authentication on your behalf if requested by the server. Here are examples for several popular git hosts (for which you’d substitute the placeholders in bold with the real values): Example 1. antora-playbook.yml (fragment) content: sources: - url: https://TOKEN:@github.com/org/project-docs - url: https://oauth2:TOKEN@gitlab.com/org/project-docs.git - url: https://gitlab+deploy-token-TOKEN_ID:TOKEN@gitlab.com/org/project-docs.git - url: https://x-oauth-token:TOKEN@bitbucket.org/org/project-docs.git - url: https://USERNAME:APP_PASSWORD@bitbucket.org/org/project-docs.git Notice that the tokens are located in different locations in the URL depending on the git host. See OAuth2 formats for more details. If you’re using a Bitbucket app password, notice you must include your own username (using the format USERNAME:APP_PASSWORD). The drawback of this approach is that it requires putting the credentials directly into the playbook file. Unfortunately, Antora does not yet support resolving environment variables located in the playbook file. However, you can emulate this behavior by using a script to substitute references to an environment variable in the playbook file with its value. Let’s assume you have the following source defined in your playbook file: Example 2. antora-playbook.yml (fragment) content: sources: - url: https://$GITHUB_TOKEN:@github.com/org-name/project-docs If you’re using multiple private repositories that require the same credentials, you can instead define the credentials once under the git key as follows: Example 3. antora-playbook.yml (fragment) git: credentials: contents: https://$GITHUB_TOKEN:@github.com You can then use the following script to expand the references to the environment variable, which you may run in CI prior to invoking Antora: $ sed -i s/\\$GITHUB_TOKEN/$GITHUB_TOKEN/ antora-playbook.yml $ antora antora-playbook.yml Despite this workaround, we still recommend using the credential store integration described earlier. The git client used by Antora, isomorphic-git, provides a pluggable credential manager for looking up authentication credentials. Antora provides a default implementation of this plugin. As you’ve seen in previous sections, this implementation assumes Antora can access the credentials directly, in plain text, either via a file or environment variable. If this arrangement does not meet your security requirements, you can replace the built-in credential manager with your own. To write a custom credential manager, export a JavaScript object that implements the following methods: Example 4. API for custom git credential manager configure ({ config, startDir }) async fill ({ url }) async approved ({ url }) async rejected ({ url, auth }) status ({ url }) The method that looks up the credentials is fill. It must return either a { username, password } or { token } data object. The approved and rejected methods are called when the credentials are approved or rejected by the server, respectively. The optional configure and status methods are specific to Antora, extending the capabilities of what a credential manager in isomorphic-git typically provides. If defined, the configure method is called each time Antora starts, providing an opportunity to perform initialization steps such as defining properties. The status method, if available, is used by Antora to look up whether authentication was requested for a given URL. To activate your custom credential manager, first write your implementation in a dedicated JavaScript file and configure it as the default export: Example 5. custom-git-credential-manager.js module.exports = { async fill ({ url }) { ... }, async approved ({ url }) { ... }, async rejected ({ url, auth }) { ... }, } Then register the credential manager with the playbook as follows: git: plugins: credential_manager: ./custom-git-credential-manager.js Alternately, you can configure the plugin to self register: Example 6. custom-git-credential-manager.js 'use strict' const git = require('isomorphic-git') if (!git.cores) git.cores = new Map() git.cores.set('antora', new Map().set('credentialManager', { async fill ({ url }) { ... }, async approved ({ url }) { ... }, async rejected ({ url, auth }) { ... }, })) Notice that in this case, the plugin name is credentialManager rather than credential_manager. That’s because the playbook builder automatically camelCases the key name for us, which is the key name that git client expects. When using a self-registering credential manager, you pass it to Antora using the -r option instead of registering it with the playbook: $ antora -r ./custom-git-credential-manager.js antora-playbook.yml If you’ve installed Antora globally using npm, you may run into problems getting your self-registering credential manager to work. Either you’ll encounter the error Cannot find module 'isomorphic-git' or your custom credential manager won’t be called. To fix this problem, set the NODE_PATH environment variable to tell Node.js where to look for Antora’s dependencies: $ NODE_PATH=$(npm -g list --parseable=true @antora/site-generator)/node_modules \\ antora -r ./custom-git-credential-manager.js antora-playbook.yml The alternate solution is to install Antora locally (i.e., add the Antora packages to the dependencies in package.json file and run npm i). Since self-registering a plugin is more complex, we’ll proceed with the example of registering the plugin in the playbook. Git offers a command named git credential that serves as a simple interface for storing and retrieving credentials from system-specific helpers in the same manner as git itself. It can also prompt the user for a username and password. We can use this command in a custom credential manager to allow Antora to delegate to git to look up credentials (and thus integrate with the user’s own git settings). Let’s start by creating a helper function that interfaces with the system git via git credentials fill to retrieve the credentials for a URL: Example 7. system-git-credential-manager.js 'use strict' const { spawn } = require('child_process') function callGitCredentialFill (url) { const { protocol, host } = new URL(url) return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const output = [] const process = spawn('git', ['credential', 'fill']) process.on('close', (code) => { if (code) return reject(code) const { username, password } = output.join('\\n').split('\\n').reduce((acc, line) => { if (line.startsWith('username') || line.startsWith('password')) { const [key, val] = line.split('=') acc[key] = val } return acc }, {}) resolve(password ? { username, password } : username ? { token: username } : undefined) }) process.stdout.on('data', (data) => output.push(data.toString().trim())) process.stdin.write(`protocol=${protocol.slice(0, -1)}\\nhost=${host}\\n\\n`) }) } Next, let’s create a credential manager that uses this function to fill the credentials for a URL: // ... module.exports = { configure () { this.urls = {} }, async fill ({ url }) { this.urls[url] = 'requested' return callGitCredentialFill(url) }, async approved ({ url }) { this.urls[url] = 'approved' }, async rejected ({ url, auth }) { this.urls[url] = 'rejected' const data = { statusCode: 401, statusMessage: 'HTTP Basic: Access Denied' } const err = new Error(`HTTP Error: ${data.statusCode} ${data.statusMessage}`) err.name = err.code = 'HttpError' err.data = data if (auth) err.rejected = true throw err }, status ({ url }) { return this.urls[url] }, } Finally, we need to register the credential manager with the playbook: git: plugins: credential_manager: ./system-git-credential-manager.js Antora will now delegate to the system git to fill the credentials for a URL: $ antora antora-playbook.yml It’s left up to an exercise for the reader to store or erase the credentials based on whether they were approved or rejected by the server (hint: use the approved and rejected methods to invoke git credential again). Since 2.0, Antora no longer supports public/private key authentication over SSH using an SSH agent. Instead, Antora transparently converts git SSH URLs in the playbook to HTTPS URLs and uses the credential manager for authentication. That means you can use SSH URLs and HTTPS URLs interchangeably in your playbook file, but ultimately the git client will communicate over HTTPS. If, for some reason, this automatic translation doesn’t work, you’ll need to update your playbook file to use the correct HTTPS URL.","title":"Private Repository Authentication","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"private-repository-auth","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/private-repository-auth.html","titles":[{"text":"Credential types","hash":"credential-types","id":1},{"text":"GitHub","hash":"github","id":2},{"text":"GitLab","hash":"gitlab","id":3},{"text":"Bitbucket","hash":"bitbucket","id":4},{"text":"Supply credentials using the default git credential store","hash":"supply-credentials-using-the-default-git-credential-store","id":5},{"text":"Populate the credential store interactively","hash":"populate-credentials-interactively","id":6},{"text":"Populate the credential store directly","hash":"populate-credentials-directly","id":7},{"text":"Specify a custom git credential store path","hash":"custom-credential-path","id":8},{"text":"Pass credentials via an environment variable","hash":"git-credentials-environment-variable","id":9},{"text":"Encode credentials in a URL (not recommended)","hash":"encode-credentials-in-a-url-not-recommended","id":10},{"text":"Configure a custom credential manager","hash":"custom","id":11},{"text":"Get credentials from git","hash":"get-credentials-from-git","id":12},{"text":"SSH authentication","hash":"ssh-auth","id":13}]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"The first time Antora runs, it caches any remote content sources git repositories and UI bundles.

Linux $XDG_CACHE_HOME/antora or $HOME/.cache/antora if $XDG_CACHE_HOME isn’t set macOS $HOME/Library/Caches/antora Windows $APPDATA/antora/Caches Before downloading remote resources, Antora will first look for them in the cache folder. If you want to update your cache, configure Antora to fetch updates. Another option is to locate the Antora cache directory on your system and manually delete it. The optional cache_dir key is configured under the runtime key in a playbook. cache_dir specifies the directory where the remote repositories should be cloned and the remote UI bundle should be downloaded. It accepts a relative or absolute filesystem path. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml runtime: cache_dir: ./.cache/antora In this case, the value resolves to the folder .cache/antora relative to the location of the playbook file. We know the resolved location is relative to the playbook file because it starts with ./. The resolution rules for cache_dir are the same as for any path in the playbook.

Activating the fetch key from a playbook or the CLI causes Antora to perform both of the following actions each time it runs: Run a fetch operation for all remote content sources repositories Antora has cloned, or clone them otherwise. Download the remote UI bundle if it’s marked as a snapshot, even if it has already been downloaded. Antora only fetches updates for remote content sources since the clones are managed by Antora. Antora never fetches updates for local content sources (i.e., local git repositories). In other words, Antora does not run git fetch or git pull on a local git repository. Doing so would runs the risk of putting them into an inconsistent state or otherwise interfering with the author’s work. Antora leaves managing the state of local content repositories up to the author. The first time Antora runs a playbook, it clones any remote content sources git repositories and downloads the UI bundle into the Antora cache directory. On subsequent runs, Antora resolves these resources in the cache folder, effectively running offline. You can instruct Antora to refresh the cache by setting the optional fetch key to true. The fetch key is configured under the runtime key in a playbook. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml runtime: fetch: true You don’t have to modify the playbook file directly to set this key.

You can configure Antora to write messages to a standard stream or a file. You can also control when and how Antora writes those log messages. The default destination file is correlated with the log format. If the log format is pretty, the default destination is the standard error stream (stderr). If the log format is json, the default destination is the standard output stream (stdout). In either case, the messages will appear in the output of your terminal. The file key allows you to control which standard stream Antora selects or to configure Antora to route the log messages to a local file. The file key is configured under the destination category key of the log category key in a playbook. The file key is optional. The value of this key can be a path to a local file, the value stdout (or 1) for the standard output stream, or the value stderr (or 2) for the standard error stream. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml runtime: log: destination: file: ./antora.log If this key is set, the specified destination is used instead of the default destination, regardless of the log format. The resolution rules for file are the same as for any path in the playbook. A relative path is expanded to an absolute path using the following rules: If the first path segment is a tilde (~), the remaining path is resolved relative to the user’s home directory. If the first path segment is a dot (.), the remaining path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file. If the first path segment is a tilde directly followed by a plus sign (~+), or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the remaining path is resolved relative to the current working directory. If the value of the file key is the path of a local file rather than a standard stream, and the log format is pretty, the messages are not colorized. Keep in mind that if you route log messages to a file, you will not see those messages in your terminal anymore. You will have to check the log file to see if Antora wrote any log messages to it. By default, Antora truncates the file before writing to it. You can alter this behavior using the append key. The append key is configured under the destination category key of the log category key in a playbook. The append key is optional. The value of this key can either be true or false. By default, the value is false. If you set the value to true, Antora will not truncate (i.e., clear) the file before writing to it. That means the log messages from a previous run of Antora will be preserved. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml runtime: log: destination: file: ./antora.log append: true This key is only relevant if the file key is specified as the path of a local file. By default, Antora will write log messages to the destination immediately. You can control this behavior using the buffer_size and sync keys. The buffer_size key is configured under the destination category key of the log category key in a playbook. The buffer_size key is optional. The value of this key can be 0 or a positive integer. The value represents the number of bytes to buffer (e.g., 4096 is 4K). By default, the value is 0, which means Antora does not buffer log messages. If the value is greater than 0, then Antora will batch log messages until they reach the specified size in bytes. Once the resident size of the buffered log messages meet or exceed this value, Antora will flush the buffer to the destination. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml runtime: log: destination: buffer_size: 4096 If you’re routing log messages to a file, the buffer_size key provides a way to avoid an excessive number of writes. You usually only need to use this key if you are encountering a resource problem when running Antora. The sync key offers an additional way to control writes. The sync key is configured under the destination category key of the log category key in a playbook. The sync key is optional. The value of this key can either be true or false. By default, the value is true, which means Antora writes to the destination using a synchronous operation. If you set the value to false, Antora will switch to writing to the destination using an asynchronous operation. This means log messages will be written the next time the Node.js process can perform an I/O operation. Example 4. antora-playbook.yml runtime: log: destination: file: ./antora.log sync: false Setting the sync key to false prevents a log event from pausing the program to complete the write. Instead, those writes are put onto a queue and performed the next time the Node.js process is idle, such as when it’s performing a network operation. In other words, the writes are naturally batched. If generating your site produces a lot of log messages, this can help Antora perform more optimally. You can combine the sync key with the buffer_size key to maximize how much log message writes are deferred.","title":"Log Destination","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"runtime-log-destination","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/runtime-log-destination.html","titles":[{"text":"Default destination","hash":"default","id":1},{"text":"file key","hash":"file-key","id":2},{"text":"append key","hash":"append-key","id":3},{"text":"buffer_size key","hash":"buffer-size-key","id":4},{"text":"sync key","hash":"sync-key","id":5}]},"202":{"id":202,"text":"The failure_level key specifies the severity threshold that, when met or exceeded, causes Antora to exit with a non-zero (i.e., failure) exit code. To be clear, this setting doesn’t stop Antora from running. Rather, it merely impacts the exit code value of the process in which Antora is running. It’s up to the shell to interpret this value, as most CI environments do. Explicitly assigning a value to the failure_level key is optional. If it isn’t set in the playbook or specified using the --log-failure-level option or ANTORA_LOG_FAILURE_LEVEL variable, Antora assigns the value fatal to the key at runtime. If a logged message meets the fatal severity threshold, Antora will exit with a non-zero exit code. The failure_level key is configured under the runtime and log keys in a playbook. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml runtime: log: failure_level: error The key accepts the following built-in values: fatal (default) error warn none These values correspond to the severity levels Antora assigns to log messages. Except when the value is none, Antora exits with a non-zero exit code if a message is logged that meets or exceeds the value assigned to failure_level. When the value is none, Antora always exits with zero exit code, even when an unhandled error is thrown. Note that when Antora’s logger is turned off, the failure_level key and its value aren’t applied. When the failure_level key is assigned the value none, Antora always exits with the exit code zero (0), even if a fatal error is encountered.

The log format, and all other log settings, are not honored if a fatal error is thrown before Antora fully configures the playbook. Instead, the error message is printed directly to standard error (STDERR). Explicitly assigning a value to the format key is optional. When format isn’t set, Antora assigns one of the key’s accepted values, either json or pretty, based on the environment it detects at runtime. Antora assigns the value pretty to the format key when Antora is running in a continuous integration environment (CI=true), the IS_TTY environment variable is true, or the terminal is interactive (TTY) and the IS_TTY environment variable is not false. In all other cases, Antora uses the json value. The format key is configured under the runtime and log keys in a playbook. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml runtime: log: format: json The format key accepts the following built-in values: json Default if the CI environment variable is not set (not running in a CI environment variable), IS_TTY=false, or the terminal is not interactive. The structured log messages are emitted in JSON format to the standard out stream (STDOUT) so they can be piped to other applications and processed. The output adheres to the JSON Lines (jsonl) text format (also known as Newline delimited JSON, or ndjson). Each message is output on its own line using UTF-8 encoding and each line is a valid JSON value. The levels of the messages are expressed as labels, error, info, etc., by default. The level format can be changed to numbers by setting the log.level_format key and assigning the value number to it. pretty Default if CI=true, IS_TTY=true, or the terminal is interactive. The log messages are formatted for readability and emitted to the standard error stream (STDERR). The format key can also be specified using the --log-format option or ANTORA_LOG_FORMAT variable. CI environment variable Continuous integration (CI) environments, such as Netlify, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and many others, typically set the continuous integration environment variable (CI) to true. Antora uses this environment variable to determine when it’s running in a CI environment and change its behavior accordingly. To emit formatted log messages, assign the pretty value to the format key in your playbook. Example 2. Assign pretty value to format key runtime: log: format: pretty Now when you run Antora, it will emit log messages to STDERR. Antora tries to be smart about the use of color. When Antora writes log messages to a standard stream, such as STDERR, it will colorize the prettified log messages if the terminal supports color. If you run Antora from your terminal, the formatted log messages are displayed there. Example 3 shows a prettified log message (without color) for an xref error. Example 3. Log message output using pretty format [16:03:00.691] ERROR (asciidoctor): target of xref not found: a-page.adoc file: /home/computer/my-projects/project/docs/modules/module-name/pages/index.adoc:54 (1) source: /home/computer/my-projects/project (refname: my-branch , start path: docs) 1 To display the line number where an error occurs, set the sourcemap key. You can prevent Antora from colorizing the prettified log messages by setting the NO_COLOR environment variable when you run Antora. $ NO_COLOR=1 antora antora-playbook.yml Antora will never apply color to the log message if the NO_COLOR environment variable is set, regardless of the capabilities of the terminal. If you want to force Antora to apply color, even if it doesn’t detect color support in the terminal, set the FORCE_COLOR environment variable instead (e.g., FORCE_COLOR=1). To emit structured log messages in JSON format, assign the json value to the format key in your playbook. Example 4. Assign json value to format key runtime: log: format: json When Antora runs, any log messages are emitted to STDOUT. Example 5 shows a structured log message about an xref error. Example 5. Log message output in JSON {\"level\":\"error\",\"time\":1627682525543,\"name\":\"asciidoctor\",\"file\":{\"path\":\"/home/computer/my-projects/project/docs/modules/module-name/pages/index.adoc\",\"line\":54},\"source\":{\"url\":\"https://gitlab.com/org/project.git\",\"worktree\":\"/home/computer/my-projects/project\",\"refname\":\"my-branch\",\"startPath\":\"docs\"},\"msg\":\"target of xref not found: a-page.adoc\"} A structured log message is made up of a series of key-value pairs. Each key indicates a log message field, such as level, and each value records the logging information for that field, such as error. JSON formatted messages can be directed to a separate application or sent to log ingestion services for parsing, search, and analysis. A popular tool for working with JSON messages is jq. jq is a JSON processor; a command line tool to select, filter, and reshape JSON messages. Here’s an example that shows how to pipe JSON formatted log messages generated by Antora to jq. $ antora antora-playbook.yml | jq Example 6 shows the result of structured log message for an xref error that’s been piped to jq to make it easier to read. Example 6. Log message output piped to jq { \"level\": \"error\", \"time\": 1627683497637, \"name\": \"asciidoctor\", \"file\": { \"path\": \"/home/user/projects/project/docs/modules/module-name/pages/index.adoc\", \"line\": 54 }, \"source\": { \"url\": \"https://gitlab.com/org/project.git\", \"worktree\": \"/home/user/projects/project\", \"refname\": \"my-branch\", \"startPath\": \"docs\" }, \"msg\": \"target of xref not found: a-page.adoc\" } You can also use jq to filter messages. For example, if you only want to see xref errors from Asciidoctor, ignoring all other errors, you can add a select filter to the jq command. $ antora --log-level=error antora-playbook.yml | \\ jq 'select(.name == \"asciidoctor\" and (.msg | contains(\" not found:\")))' If you’re only building part of your site, and you want to filter out warnings to “offsite” pages, you can add an ignore filter to the jq command. $ antora antora-playbook.yml | \\ jq 'select(.msg | contains(\" not found: missing-component-name:\") | not)' You can pipe to jq multiple times to select or ignore additional messages. See the reference documentation for the select function to learn more about how to use it. If you want the result set from jq to be displayed in prettified format, you can pipe that result to pino-pretty. Since pino-pretty is a dependency of Antora, you can invoke it using npx. $ antora antora-playbook.yml | jq -cM | npx pino-pretty The -c option tells jq to keep the output in JSON lines format and the -M option turns off color in the data passed to pino-pretty. The prettified messages aren’t quite as pretty as the output Antora produces, though it is possible to customize pino-pretty to achieve a similar result. You don’t have to modify the playbook file directly to set the format key. You can use the --log-format option from the CLI. $ antora --log-format=json antora-playbook.yml The --log-format option overrides the value assigned to the format key or to the ANTORA_LOG_FORMAT environment variable. However, recall that if you pipe the output to another program, and the log format has not been specified, Antora will automatically switch to the JSON format. When the log format is JSON (json), each log level correlates to a label and a number. The JSON format expresses a level as a label, such as error or info, by default. However, some tools require the level to be a number. The format of the level can be configured with the level_format key. The level_format key is configured under the runtime and log keys in a playbook. Example 7. Assign number value to level_format key runtime: log: format: json level_format: number The level_format key accepts the built-in values label and number. The default value is label. If the log format is pretty, the value assigned to the level_format key is ignored and levels are always expressed as labels.

The steps in the following sections will walk you through setting up a playbook that configures a site title and URL, fetches source files from the Demo Component A and Demo Component B repositories, and applies Antora’s reference UI to the converted pages. First, let’s configure your site’s title and URL. Open a new file in the text editor or IDE of your choice. You’ll typically name this file antora-playbook.yml. On the first line, type site: and press Enter to go to the next line. site: The site key accepts a map of key-value pairs that define global site properties. The title key is a child of site. Type title: and then the text that will become the title of your site. Press Enter. site: title: My Demo Site Type url: and then the base URL of your site. site: title: My Demo Site url: https://docs.demo.com Assigning an absolute URL to the url key activates secondary features such as the sitemap. On the next line, enter start_page: and the page ID of the page Antora should use as the site’s home page. site: title: My Demo Site url: https://docs.demo.com start_page: component-b::index.adoc The start_page value in the example above is the page ID for the latest version of the file index.adoc that belongs to Component B. In order for Antora to use this page, you need to tell Antora where to find the source files that belong to Component B. In the next section, let’s define the content sources URLs, branches, and start paths. Antora needs to know what git repositories, branches, and tags it should locate and fetch source files from, as well as the location of any content source roots that aren’t at the root of a repository. Let’s define these keys in the playbook file you started in the previous section. Type content: flush against the left side of the file. Press Enter to go to the next line. # ... start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: The sources key is a child of content. Type sources: and press Enter. # ... start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: sources: The sources key requires at least one url key be assigned a remote repository URL or filesystem path. Let’s assign the URL for a remote repository named Demo Component A to url in the next step. Type a hyphen (-) followed by a blank space. Then type url: and the URL of a content source repository. # ... start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git Now, Antora can locate the Demo Component A repository. But it also needs to know what branches and tags it should fetch. The default branches filter is applied at runtime when a url key doesn’t have a branches or tags key set on it. Since the Demo Component A repository only has one branch, and that branch’s name (main) falls within the parameters of the default filter, you don’t need to explicitly set branches on this url key. Let’s add the URL for the Demo Component B repository. On a new line, type - url: and the repository’s URL. # ... start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git The Demo Component B repository uses branches for versioning. The content source files in the branches v1.0 and v2.0 are ready for publishing. However, you can’t use the default branches filter on this url because the files in the main branch shouldn’t be published to the site. Instead, you’ll have to tell Antora what branches it should fetch from the Demo Component B repository. On the next line, type branches: and an opening square bracket ([). Inside the [, type each branch name that Antora should fetch. Separate the values with commas. It doesn’t matter what order you list the branch names. At the end of the list, type a closing square bracket (]). Press Enter. # ... start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v2.0, v1.0] Make sure to indent branches enough so the u in url and b in branches are lined up. The branches key also accepts shell glob patterns. For instance, you could define branches: v* on the url key for Demo Component B to specify that Antora fetch the branches with the names v1.0 and v2.0. You’re not done configuring the keys for the Demo Component B repository just yet. The content source root in each branch isn’t at the root of the repository, it’s at docs. You’ll need to set the start_path key on url so Antora can locate the content source root. Type start_path: and the repository root relative path. # ... start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v2.0, v1.0] start_path: docs Don’t add leading or trailing slashes to the path. Now, you’re ready to configure the final set of required keys that will tell Antora what UI it should apply to the site. Antora needs a UI bundle in order to generate a site. Let’s tell Antora to use it’s reference UI bundle by defining the required keys in the playbook file you worked on in the previous sections. Flush against the left side of the file, type ui:. Press Enter to go to the next line. # ... start_path: docs ui: The bundle key is a child of ui. Type bundle: and press Enter. # ... start_path: docs ui: bundle: The url key is a child of bundle. Type url: and then the URL of Antora’s reference UI bundle. # ... start_path: docs ui: bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable Antora’s reference UI archive changes over time, but its URL doesn’t, so you need to activate the snapshot key. On the next line, enter snapshot: and the value true. # ... start_path: docs ui: bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable snapshot: true When snapshot is set to true, Antora will download the UI bundle whenever fetch is activated in the playbook or from the CLI. You’re almost done! Here’s the entire playbook file you’ve assembled so far. site: title: My Demo Site url: https://docs.demo.com start_page: component-b::index.adoc content: sources: - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git branches: [v2.0, v1.0] start_path: docs ui: bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable snapshot: true This playbook will generate a site named My Demo Site using the content files from the specified repository branches and the UI files from the specified UI bundle. All you’ve got to do before running Antora on this playbook is save it. Playbook files are often saved with the filename antora-playbook.yml or a related filename, such as local-antora-playbook.yml, depending on the context in which it’s used.

The start_page key is optional. It’s configured under the site key in a playbook. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Site Title url: https://example.org start_page: component:module:file-coordinate-of-page.adoc You can use any page that belongs to a component version as the index page for your site. The start_page key accepts the resource ID of a page as a value. The resource ID must include the component, module, and file coordinates. The version coordinate can be specified if you want to use a specific version of a page instead of the latest version. Alternatively, start_page can be assigned from the CLI. If your site has an unversioned component named ROOT (i.e., name: ROOT, version: ~), that component will be published to the root of the site. The component name will not appear in the URL of those pages. That means that the index.adoc page in the ROOT module (i.e., modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc) of the unversioned ROOT component implicitly acts as the site start page without having to specify it in the playbook. In other words, the site start page is effectively ROOT::index.adoc. If you specify a different site start page in this case, it will be ignored since the site already has a start page. To have the start_page key always point to the latest version of the specified page, don’t enter the version coordinate in the resource ID of the page.

If this key isn’t set, certain features of the site that require a site URL are automatically deactivated. See When should the site URL be set? for details. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Site Title url: https://docs.example.com The url key defines the location where the site can be accessed once it’s published. The value of the url key can either be an absolute URL (https://docs.example.com, https://example.com/docs) or a root-relative URL (/products). Do not include a trailing forward slash in the url value unless the value is a single forward slash (/). The site URL appears in the generated site wherever an absolute URL or a root-relative URL is required. See How Antora Builds URLs to learn more. Alternatively, the url key can be assigned from the CLI using a --url option or using the URL environment variable. An absolute URL value starts with a URL scheme directly followed by a colon and two forward slashes (https://) and a domain (docs.example.org). Do not put a trailing forward slash at the end of the URL. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Docs for Example Site url: https://docs.example.com Absolute site URLs can include a subpath (e.g., https://example.com/docs, https://example.com/path/to/subfolder). The subpath, also known as a path segment or pathname, represents the location from the root of the domain where the site managed by Antora is published. If your site is published to a subfolder of your domain, then the absolute site URL must include this path. The subpath has the same syntax as a root-relative URL. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Docs for Example Site url: https://example.com/docs When an absolute site URL has a subpath, Antora extracts the subpath and assigns it to the site pathname (/docs, /path/to/subfolder) for use wherever a domain-relative URL is required. See When should the site URL include a subpath? for more information about publishing your site to a domain subfolder. The root-relative URL is a URL that’s relative to the domain, but without having to specify the domain itself. A root-relative URL must start with a forward slash (/products). Example 4. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Docs Hosted Somewhere url: /products You might use a root-relative URL instead of an absolute URL if identical sites must be published to or accessible via multiple domains. By using a root-relative URL, you can take advantage of many of the benefits of assigning a site URL. However, Antora deactivates any feature that depends on an absolute site URL when the value assigned to url isn’t absolute. Antora assigns the root-relative URL directly to the site pathname for computing domain-relative URLs. If you want to set url to a root-relative URL, but want the site pathname to be empty, set the value to a single forward slash. Example 5. antora-playbook.yml site: title: The Docs url: / An Antora site is designed to be viewable offline and from a local filesystem. For this reason, the site URL is not required to build the site. However, there are certain features related to publishing that require a site URL, some even an absolute URL. When the site URL is not set, these features are automatically deactivated without notice. This section identifies these features and which kind of site URL they require. When the site URL is set to any allowable value, the following features are enabled: The site-url attribute is set on every AsciiDoc document. The site.url property is set in the UI model (using the value of the site.url key in the playbook). The site pathname property, site.path, is set in the UI model (derived from the site.url key in the playbook). The 404 page is generated. The robots.txt file is generated if site.robots is also defined in the playbook. Redirects include the site pathname (site.path), if non-empty. This does not affect the static redirect facility, which uses relative URLs. The link in the top-left corner of the navbar points to the site URL instead of a relative path (behavior specific to the default UI). When the site URL is set to an absolute URL, the following additional features are enabled: The sitemap files are generated. The page.canonicalUrl is set in the UI model, which gets used by the reference UI to create the canonical link tag in the head. If the site URL is not set, all the aforementioned features are deactivated. The subpath of a site URL represents the location from the root of the domain where the site managed by Antora is located. In other words, the site URL takes the visitor to the URL where the redirect for the site start page is located. If your site is published to a subfolder of your domain, then the site URL should include this path (e.g., /path/to/subfolder). When required, Antora uses the site URL to construct absolute and domain-relative URLs to pages in your site, which will always include the subpath, if specified. This includes URLs in the sitemap (absolute URLs) as well as rewrite rules (domain-relative URLs). Let’s consider an example of how the subpath is used when creating a server redirect rule. Assume the following conditions are true: The site is published to the docs subfolder of the example.com domain. The page new-page.adoc in the ROOT module of the versionless component-a component defines the page alias old-page.adoc (meaning old-page.adoc was renamed to new-page.adoc). The redirect facility is set as nginx. You set the site url key to https://example.com (the incorrect value) in your playbook. When you run Antora, it generates the following redirect rule: Example 6. A redirect entry that does not includes a subpath /component-a/old-page.html /component-a/new-page.html 301! Notice that the domain-relative URLs in the redirect rule don’t include the leading /docs segment. That means if you visit https://example.com/docs/component-a/old-page.html, you are not redirected to the new page, because the rule won’t match. Let’s fix that. Edit your playbook and set the url key to https://example.com/docs. Now when you run Antora, it generates the correct redirect rule: Example 7. A redirect entry that includes a subpath /docs/component-a/old-page.html /docs/component-a/new-page.html 301! Notice the leading /docs segment is present in the domain-relative URLs. Now, when you visit https://example.com/docs/component-a/old-page.html, you’re redirected to the new page. It’s important to include the path in the absolute site URL if your site is published to a subfolder of your domain. If you don’t want to couple your site to a specific domain, assign a root-relative site URL instead. Either way, if you’re publishing your site to a subfolder of your domain, you should include the subpath in the value you assign to the url key of the site. Antora provides built-in support for canonical URLs. A canonical URL is the absolute URL of the preferred version of a page; the page you want a search engine to index. If you assign an absolute URL to the site URL, Antora computes and assigns the canonical URL to the page.canonicalUrl property in the UI model for any applicable page. An applicable page is any publishable page in a component that has at least one non-prerelease version. If the site URL is not set to an absolute URL, or the page is not in a component with at least one non-prerelease version, Antora does not populate the canonical URL. The canonical URL is the absolute URL of the newest, non-prerelease version of a page. The canonical URL is computed by prepending the site URL (including the subpath) to the (root-relative) URL of that page. The canonical URL points to the current page only if the current page is the newest non-prerelease version. Otherwise, the canonical URL points to the newest, non-prerelease version of the current page. If the page has been deleted, the newest version of a page may not be in the latest version of the component. In order for the canonical URL to be picked up by the search crawler, the UI template must include it in the page. The canonical URL should be declared as the value of the href attribute on a tag inside the tag of the page. Antora’s default UI does this for you. Here’s the template logic from Antora’s default UI that generates this tag: {{#with page.canonicalUrl}} {{/with}} Here’s how the canonical URL appears in the generated page: Assuming the page to which the canonical URL refers is present in all versions of the component, all versions of the page will contain the same tag. If the page is in a prerelease version, it will refer back to the page in the latest (non-prerelease) version. It’s up the creator of a custom UI to decide whether to include the canonical URL in the page template. Antora merely makes the information available via the UI page model. Antora’s default UI includes the required tag in the page template. The purpose of the canonical URL is to help search engines correlate versions of the same page and to suggest which version of the page is preferred (i.e., the version to index). When the search engine comes across a page which has a canonical URL that’s different from the current URL, the search engine should not index that page, but rather index the page to which the canonical URL points. By defining the canonical URL, it should ensure that old versions of a page do not show up in search results. One caveat is that if a page is present in old versions of a component, but not the latest version, the canonical URL will point to a page in an older version, and thus be indexed. If you do not want this to happen, make sure that another page in the latest version of the component claims that page using a page alias. That way, Antora will configure the canonical URL to point to the page that claims that page, thus avoiding the old page from being indexed. Use the URL inspection tool to see what canonical URL Google has detected for a page, and whether a page is indexed. See Consolidating duplicate URLs and Canonical URL to learn more about canonical URLs and how search engines like Google interpret them.","title":"Site URL","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"site-url","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/site-url.html","titles":[{"text":"url key","hash":"url-key","id":1},{"text":"Configure an absolute site URL","hash":"absolute-site-url","id":2},{"text":"Configure a root-relative site URL","hash":"root-relative-site-url","id":3},{"text":"When should the site URL be set?","hash":"when-should-the-site-url-be-set","id":4},{"text":"Features that depend on the site URL","hash":"site-url-features","id":5},{"text":"When should the site URL include a subpath?","hash":"subpath","id":6},{"text":"Canonical URL","hash":"canonical-url","id":7},{"text":"Canonical URL link tag","hash":"canonical-url-link-tag","id":8},{"text":"How the canonical URL works","hash":"how-the-canonical-url-works","id":9}]},"211":{"id":211,"text":"A UI bundle is a ZIP archive or directory that contains one or more UIs for a site. The only required file in the UI bundle is the default layout for pages (e.g., layouts/default.hbs) (and, if the 404 page is enabled, layouts/404.hbs as well). Antora automatically fetches and loads a UI bundle when generating a site. The url key is required. This key is configured under the bundle key of the ui category key in a playbook. The url key accepts a URL or filesystem path from where Antora can locate and fetch the site’s UI bundle. The filesystem path must point to a ZIP archive or a local directory where the ZIP archive has been extracted. Example 1. antora-playbook.adoc ui: (1) bundle: (2) url: https://repo.org/path/to/a-ui-bundle.zip (3) 1 Enter the parent key ui, followed by a colon (:), and then press Enter. 2 The bundle key is a child of ui. Enter the key’s name, bundle, followed by a colon (:), and then press Enter. 3 The url key is a child of bundle. Enter url, followed by a colon and a blank space (: ), and then enter a URL or filesystem path value. Alternatively, the url key can be assigned from the CLI. The UI bundle can be augmented using a supplemental UI. When the value of url is a remote URL, Antora downloads and caches the UI bundle the first time it runs. In this case, the target must be a ZIP archive. Example 2. Remote UI bundle ui: bundle: url: https://repo.org/path/to/a-ui-bundle.zip The UI bundle is cached based on the signature of the URL. On subsequent runs, Antora loads the bundle from the cache as long as the value of url remains unchanged. This saves Antora from having to download the bundle each time you generate your site. Antora won’t download the UI bundle again if it exists in the cache, even when fetch is enabled. If the url value remains the same, but the archive it points to changes over time, the UI bundle needs to be identified as a snapshot to bypass this cache. In order to retrieve UI bundle updates without changing the url value, you need to enable the snapshot key adjacent to the url key. By default, snapshot is not enabled (set to false). When snapshot is set to true, Antora will download the UI bundle whenever the fetch key under the runtime category of the playbook is enabled. The fetch key instructs Antora to retrieve updates (including the UI bundle snapshot). Example 3. Remote UI bundle marked as a snapshot ui: bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable snapshot: true If you’re using Antora’s reference UI bundle, you should mark the bundle as a snapshot because its URL never changes. If you want to control when Antora retrieves updates, pass the --fetch option when invoking the antora command. To make this setting permanent, set the runtime.fetch key in the playbook to true. Example 4. Fetch updates as persistent setting runtime: fetch: true The snapshot key is only required if you’re referring to a remote bundle (which Antora caches by default). If you’re referencing a bundle from the filesystem, Antora will always use the file specified. The url key can reference a local UI bundle using an absolute or relative filesystem path. Example 5. Relative UI bundle path ui: bundle: url: ./../docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip A relative path is expanded to an absolute path using the following rules: If the first path segment is a tilde (~), the remaining path is resolved relative to the user’s home directory. If the first path segment is a dot (.), the remaining path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file. If the first path segment is a tilde directly followed by a plus sign (~+), or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the remaining path is resolved relative to the current working directory. Here’s the path to the same UI bundle, but using an absolute path instead. Example 6. Absolute UI bundle path ui: bundle: url: /home/user/projects/docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip Here’s the path to the location where the UI bundle has been extracted (or it was organized with the same layout as an extracted archive). Example 7. Extracted UI bundle path ui: bundle: url: ./../docs-ui/build/ui-bundle-extracted Loading the UI bundle from a local directory is a good way to debug the logic. The start_path key is mapped to the bundle key. It accepts a the relative path inside the UI bundle from where Antora should start reading files. This key is useful when a UI bundle packages multiple UIs (e.g., light, dark, etc.). Example 8.

It accepts a value that’s the stem of a layout file (i.e., the name of the file without the file extension). The specified layout file is expected to be located in the UI bundle’s layouts directory.

These files are referred to collectively as the supplemental UI because they supplement the files provided by the UI bundle. The supplemental UI is useful for customizing an existing UI bundle without having to create a new one. It should not, however, be used as a replacement for developing a custom UI bundle. Rather, it should be used to make a few minor adjustments or additions to suit a particular environment. One such example is a favicon. Since the favicon is part of the brand identity, you may want to use an off-the-shelf UI bundle, but add your own favicon to it. You can use the supplemental UI to accomplish this goal. The supplemental UI is overlaid onto the files in the loaded UI bundle. If the path of a file in the supplemental UI does not match the path of a file in the UI bundle, that file is added to the files from the UI bundle. If the path of a file in the supplemental UI matches the path of a file in the UI bundle, the file from the supplemental UI replaces the file from the UI bundle. The files in the supplemental UI are not otherwise processed. The supplemental UI is configured using the supplemental_files key under the ui category key. The key accepts either the path of a directory that contains the supplemental files or a map of virtual files. Currently, these two value types are mutually exclusive. If the value of the supplemental_files key is a string, Antora assumes this value is the path of a directory. The value may be specified as a relative or absolute filesystem path. A relative path is expanded to an absolute path using the following rules: If the first path segment is a tilde (~), the remaining path is resolved relative to the user’s home directory. If the first path segment is a dot (.), the remaining path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file. If the first path segment is a tilde directly followed by a plus sign (~+), or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the remaining path is resolved relative to the current working directory. ui: supplemental_files: ./supplemental-ui Antora scans this directory for files and adds them to the loaded UI bundle. The directory is assumed to be the root of the UI hierarchy. Therefore, the UI path is the path of the file relative to this directory. Let’s assume you want to replace the head-meta partial with your own. Create the file at supplemental-ui/partials/head-meta.hbs relative to the playbook file. Next, populate it with HTML and any optional template logic that you want to include. Example 1. supplemental-ui/partials/head-meta.hbs {{#with site.keys.googleSiteVerification}} {{/with}} Antora will now use this partial in place of the head-meta partial provided by the UI. As an alternative to a directory, you can specify the supplemental UI files directly in the playbook as virtual files. If the value of the supplemental_files key is an array, Antora assumes that each entry is a virtual file. A virtual file entry consists of two keys, path and contents. The path key is the relative path of the file in the UI (e.g., partials/head-meta.hbs). The contents can be the specified directory or sourced from a file on the filesystem. If the value of the contents key is a single line and ends with a file extension (e.g., .hbs), Antora assumes the value is the path of a file specified as a relative or absolute filesystem path. Otherwise, Antora uses the value as entered as the contents. If Antora determines the value is a file path, it reads the file and assigns the contents to the virtual file. If you omit the contents key, Antora will create an empty file. Let’s assume you want to replace the head-meta partial with your own. You can define it as a virtual file in the playbook: ui: supplemental_files: - path: partials/head-meta.hbs contents: | {{#with site.keys.googleSiteVerification}} {{/with}} You could also put the contents in a file and reference it from the virtual file entry: ui: supplemental_files: - path: partials/head-meta.hbs contents: ./supplemental-ui/partials/head-meta.hbs If you are only defining a few small files, you can usually manage to define them directly in the playbook. If the files are larger, or you need to share them between multiple playbooks, its best to store them in separate files. By default, publishable assets provided by the supplemental UI, such as images and JavaScript files, are published to the UI output directory. It’s possible to configure certain files to be published to the root of the published site. These files are referred to as static files. Static files are identified using the UI descriptor, ui.yml, which also must be provided by the supplemental UI. The UI descriptor is a YAML file that configures certain aspects of the UI. To create a static file, first create a file in the supplemental UI, typically outside of any of the standard folders. A good example of a static file is the favicon, favicon.ico, at the root of the site. Let’s assume you have put a favicon in the supplemental-ui directory. If you’re loading the supplemental UI from a path, add a ui.yml file with the following contents: Example 2. ui.yml static_files: - favicon.ico The static_files key accepts an array of strings. Each entry is the relative path to the file within the UI (it should not begin with a forward slash). Antora will pick up this file, see that that favicon is a static file, and publish it to the root of the site instead of the UI output directory. If you’re defining the supplemental UI as virtual files, you need to add an entry for both the favicon and ui.yml file. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml ui: supplemental_files: - path: favicon.ico contents: ./supplemental-ui/favicon.ico - path: ui.yml contents: | static_files: - favicon.ico If the UI bundle contains a ui.yml file, you will need to replicate its contents when redefining it for the supplemental UI. That’s because the file in the supplemental UI overwrites the file provided by the UI bundle. Although the supplemental UI provides a convenient way to add static files to the site, you may want to consider using an extension instead.","title":"Supplemental UI","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"ui-supplemental-files","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/ui-supplemental-files.html","titles":[{"text":"How it works","hash":"how-it-works","id":1},{"text":"supplemental_files key","hash":"supplemental-files-key","id":2},{"text":"Directory","hash":"directory","id":3},{"text":"Virtual files","hash":"virtual-files","id":4},{"text":"Static files","hash":"static-files","id":5}]},"215":{"id":215,"text":"Antora allows you to customize the file extension used in the URL of HTML pages. By default, the URL will end with .html, mirroring the name of the published file. If you want to “prettify” the URL by hiding the extension for SEO or other reasons, you can configure Antora to do so. You either have the option to drop the extension outright or to replace the extension with forward slash (a technique known as indexify). When using either of these options, Antora will also drop the last URL segment if the source page is named index.adoc. This page explains how to control this setting. The html_extension_style key is optional. It’s configured under the urls key in a playbook. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml urls: html_extension_style: indexify It accepts the following built-in values: default Published page URLs are displayed with the .html extension, i.e., https://base-url.com/component/version/module/my-file.html. Antora automatically applies this style when html_extension_style isn’t set in the playbook or via the CLI. indexify The .html extension is dropped and a forward slash (/) is appended to the end of the published page URLs, i.e., https://base-url.com/component/version/module/my-file/. This is the preferred style if you don’t want the .html extension to appear in URLs. drop The .html extension is dropped from the end of the published page URLs, i.e., https://base-url.com/component/version/module/my-file. This style requires support from the web server and should only be used if you’re comfortable applying the necessary web server configuration. Antora will automatically assign the value default to the html_extension_style key at runtime if it isn’t set in the playbook or in the CLI using the --html-url-extension-style option. The default style appends the .html extension to the end of every published page’s URL. For example, the resulting URL for the page my-file.adoc would be displayed in a browser with .html appended to the end, i.e., https://base-url.com/component/version/module/my-file.html. Let’s assign indexify to the html_extension_style key. Example 2. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Site Title url: https://example.org urls: html_extension_style: indexify When indexify is applied, the site’s published URLs don’t end with the extension .html. Instead, a forward slash (/) is appended directly to the end of the page stem. This results in the URL for the page my-file.adoc to be displayed in a browser as https://example.com/component/version/module/my-file/. To locally preview all the features of a site, such as redirects and the 404 page, when html_extension_style is assigned indexify, you’ll need to run a local server. Let’s assign drop to the html_extension_style key. Example 3. antora-playbook.yml site: title: Site Title url: https://example.org urls: html_extension_style: drop When drop is applied, the site’s published URLs don’t end with the extension .html. This results in the URL for the page my-file.adoc to be displayed in a browser as https://example.com/component/version/module/my-file. In order for the site to work properly when using this style, you must view the site through a web server. You also need to configure the web server to look for a file with the .html extension. Not all web servers have the ability to support extensionless HTML URLs. If you’re using nginx, you need to add the following directive to the location / stanza in the configuration for your host: location / { # ... try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/index.html = 404; } This directive tells nginx to first look for the requested file, then look for the same file with the .html extension added, then look for a file named index.html in a directory that matches the requested file. These attempts match the layout of the published files.","title":"HTML Extension Styles","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"urls-html-extension-style","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/urls-html-extension-style.html","titles":[{"text":"html_extension_style key","hash":"html-extension-style-key","id":1},{"text":"Using the default style","hash":"default","id":2},{"text":"Apply the indexify style","hash":"indexify-style","id":3},{"text":"Apply the drop style","hash":"drop-style","id":4}]},"216":{"id":216,"text":"The latest_prerelease_version_segment key replaces the actual version in the URL of resources in the latest prerelease with a symbolic prerelease version. In order for a version be classified as a prerelease, the component must also have at least one non-prerelease version. If a component only has prerelease versions, the latest version is not classified as a prerelease even if the prerelease key is set in the component descriptor. When a component only has prerelease versions, then the value of the latest_version_segment is used instead. This behavior may change in the future. The latest_prerelease_version_segment key is configured in the playbook under the urls key. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml urls: latest_prerelease_version_segment: unstable The value assigned to the latest_prerelease_version_segment key is the symbolic prerelease version. Antora replaces the actual version in the version segment of the latest prerelease component versions’ URLs with the symbolic prerelease version. A component version must be designated as a prerelease and Antora must determine that it is the latest prerelease of a component for the value assigned to the latest_prerelease_version_segment key to be applied to its page and asset URLs. Depending on the strategy assigned to the latest_version_segment_strategy key, Antora may apply additional redirect rules when routing to or from symbolic and actual version URLs. The same requirements that apply to the value of the version key also apply to the latest_prerelease_version_segment key. The value can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). To ensure portability between host platforms, use lowercase letters. The value of the latest_prerelease_version_segment key cannot contain spaces, forward slashes (/), or HTML special characters (&, ). The value can only be empty if the value of latest_version_segment_strategy is redirect:to or replace. The value cannot be empty if the value of latest_version_segment_strategy is redirect:from. This restriction is due to the fact that redirecting from the parent folder could prevent access to other versions. This section explores the results of assigning a symbolic prerelease version to the latest_prerelease_version_segment key. The examples in this section use the component version defined by the component version descriptor file shown in Example 2. Example 2 defines a component version with the name colorado and version 6.0. Example 2. Component version descriptor (antora.yml file) defining the colorado 6.0 component version name: colorado version: '6.0' (1) prerelease: -beta.2 (2) 1 The version key in antora.yml defines the component’s actual version as 6.0. 2 The prerelease key and assigned identifier, -beta.2, informs Antora that the component version is a prerelease. The colorado 6.0 component version has a page named tour.adoc that belongs to the module get-started. First, let’s review the URL Antora makes by default. That is, when the latest_prerelease_version_segment key isn’t set in the playbook. By default, Antora uses the actual version in the version segment of page and asset URLs, even when the component version is a prerelease with an identifier. Example 3 shows the default URL for the tour.adoc page that belongs to the colorado 6.0 component version. Example 3. URL for colorado 6.0 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/6.0/get-started/tour.html Now, let’s assign a symbolic prerelease version to the latest prerelease component versions in this site. The latest_prerelease_version_segment key is configured in the playbook file, not the component version descriptor files, because it applies to all of the latest prerelease component versions in a site. Example 4 shows a truncated playbook file with the latest_prerelease_version_segment key defined. Example 4. Playbook (antora-playbook.yml file) defining a symbolic prerelease version site: title: The Ranges url: https://docs.example.com urls: latest_prerelease_version_segment: next (1) content: # ... 1 The latest_prerelease_version_segment is set under the urls key and assigned the value next. Let’s assume that, according to its semantic and named version sorting rules, Antora determines that colorado 6.0 is the latest prerelease version of the colorado component. Using information from the playbook and the component version’s antora.yml file, Antora constructs the following URL for the tour.adoc page. Now, in Example 5, the version segment contains the symbolic prerelease version, next. Example 5. URL for colorado 6.0 tour.adoc page when latest_prerelease_version_segment is set https://docs.example.com/colorado/next/get-started/tour.html The actual version with appended prerelease identifier, 6.0-beta.2, is still displayed in the reference UI menus. The symbolic prerelease version, next, is only used in the URLs. To customize the value displayed in the reference UI menus, use the display_version key. The examples in this section assumed the latest_version_segment_strategy key wasn’t set. Therefore, when Antora detected the latest_prerelease_version_segment key, it automatically set the latest_version_segment_strategy key and assigned it the replace strategy at runtime.

As the key’s name implies, the selected strategy only applies to the latest version or latest prerelease version of a component version. The latest_version_segment_strategy key is optional. It’s configured under the urls key in the playbook. The latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key must be set as well, otherwise Antora deactivates the specified strategy as there isn’t a symbolic version to replace the actual version with in the URLs. The specified strategy and symbolic version are only applied to the latest version or latest prerelease version of each component in your site. The URLs for all other component versions use the actual version in the version segment of the URL. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml urls: (1) latest_version_segment_strategy: redirect:to (2) latest_prerelease_version_segment: next (3) 1 Type the parent key urls, followed by a colon (:), and press Enter to go to a new line. 2 The latest_version_segment_strategy key must be nested under the urls key. Type latest_version_segment_strategy, followed by a colon and a space (: ), then type the built-in strategy value you want Antora to use, and press Enter. This example uses the value redirect:to. 3 Type latest_prerelease_version_segment, followed by a colon and a space (: ), and then type your symbolic version value. This example uses the symbolic version next for the latest prerelease version segment. The latest_version_segment_strategy key accepts the following built-in values: redirect:from Sets up redirects from the URLs using the symbolic version to the URLs using the actual version, which may be empty. The actual version is replaced by the symbolic version specified by the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key in the latest component versions’ page and asset URLs. This strategy is currently ignored when the redirect facility is static. redirect:to Sets up redirects from the URLs using the non-emtpy actual version to the URLs using the symbolic version. The actual version is replaced by the symbolic version specified by the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key in the latest component versions’ page and asset URLs. No change is made to the URL if the version is empty. This strategy is transparently changed to replace when the redirect facility is static. replace Default. The non-empty actual version is replaced by the symbolic version specified by the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key in the latest component versions’ page and asset URLs. replace is the default value when the latest_version_segment_strategy key isn’t set, but the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key is assigned a value in the playbook. No change is made to the URL if the version is empty. Antora creates temporary redirects (302) when the strategy is redirect:to or redirect:from. The format of the rules and redirect configuration file is determined by the redirect facility you specify using the redirect_facility key. Note that when the redirect_facility key isn’t defined in the playbook or CLI, Antora assigns the static value to the key at runtime. Since creating temporary redirect rules is only something a web server can do, when using the static redirect facility, the redirect:from strategy is ignored and the redirect:to strategy effectively becomes the replace strategy. If the value of latest_version_segment_strategy key is redirect:from, the value of the latest_version_segment and latest_prerelease_version_segment cannot be empty. This restriction is due to the fact that redirecting from the parent folder could prevent access to other versions. For the same reason, the redirect:to and replace strategies have no affect if the actual version is empty. When replace is your preferred strategy, you don’t need to set the latest_version_segment_strategy key as long as you assign a value to the latest_version_segment key or latest_prerelease_version_segment key in the playbook. Example 2. Use replace by default at runtime # ... urls: latest_version_segment: stable content: # ... When Antora reads the playbook in Example 2 and detects that the latest_version_segment key is set and assigned a value but that the latest_version_segment_strategy key isn’t, Antora automatically sets latest_version_segment_strategy and assigns it replace at runtime. Likewise, if only the latest_prerelease_version_segment key is set and assigned a value, Antora automatically sets latest_version_segment_strategy and assigns it replace at runtime. This section explores the results of using the redirect:to strategy to redirect the URLs using the actual version of the latest component versions to the URLs using the symbolic version. The examples in this section use the component versions defined by the component version descriptor files shown in Example 3 and Example 4. Example 3 defines a component version with the component name colorado and the version 5.2. Example 3. Component version descriptor (antora.yml file) defining the colorado 5.2 component version name: colorado version: '5.2' (1) 1 The version key in antora.yml defines the component’s actual version as 5.2. Example 4 defines a component version with the name colorado and the version 5.6. Example 4. Component version descriptor (antora.yml file) defining the colorado 5.6 component version name: colorado version: '5.6' (1) 1 The version key in antora.yml defines the component’s actual version as 5.6. Both component versions have a page named tour.adoc that belongs to the module get-started. Now, let’s assign a latest version segment strategy and a latest version URL segment to the latest component versions. This information is provided to Antora using your site’s playbook file. The latest_version_segment_strategy and latest_version_segment keys are configured in the playbook file (not the component version descriptor file) under the urls key. Example 5 shows these keys defined in a playbook file. Example 5. Playbook (antora-playbook.yml file) defining a latest version segment strategy site: title: The Ranges url: https://docs.example.com urls: latest_version_segment_strategy: redirect:to (1) latest_version_segment: current (2) redirect_facility: nginx (3) content: # ... 1 Antora will use the redirect:to strategy when generating the redirect rules for the latest component version URLs. 2 Antora will replace the actual version with the symbolic version, current, in the URLs of the latest component versions. 3 Antora will generate an nginx redirect file and place it at the root of the generated site at .etc/nginx/rewrite.conf. Assuming Example 3 and Example 4 are the only component versions in the site, Antora identifies colorado 5.6 as the latest version of the colorado component. Antora determines the latest component version and order of versions based on its semantic and named version sorting rules. As shown in Example 6, the version segment uses the actual version because colorado 5.2 isn’t the latest version of the colorado component. Example 6. URL for colorado 5.2 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.2/get-started/tour.html However, in Example 7, the version segment uses the symbolic version, current, because colorado 5.6 is the latest version of the colorado component. Example 7. URL for colorado 5.6 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/current/get-started/tour.html In addition to replacing the actual version with the symbolic version in the URLs of the latest component versions, Antora creates temporary redirects from the URLs using the actual version to the URLs using the symbolic version. The playbook in Example 5 assigns the nginx value to the redirect_facility key, therefore Antora writes the redirect rules to an nginx rewrite configuration file named rewrite.conf and places it in the site at .etc/nginx/rewrite.conf. Any request for a URL using the actual version of a latest component version, as long as the version is not empty, is redirected to the URL with the symbolic version. For example, if the URL https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.6/get-started/tour.html is requested, the URL redirects to https://docs.example.com/colorado/current/get-started/tour.html. Continuing the scenario presented in the previous section, let’s explore what happens when a new component version is added to the site. Example 8 defines a component version with the name colorado and the actual version 6.0. Example 8. Component version descriptor (antora.yml file) defining the colorado 6.0 component version name: colorado version: '6.0' The site uses the same playbook in Example 5. During generation, Antora determines that highest version of the colorado component is version 6.0, therefore colorado 6.0 becomes the latest version of the colorado component. Using the component versions defined in Example 3 (colorado 5.2), Example 4 (colorado 5.6), Example 8 (colorado 6.0), and the playbook in Example 5, Antora constructs the following URLs for the tour.adoc page in each component version. Example 9 shows that the tour.adoc page URL in the component version colorado 5.2 remains the same. Example 9. URL for colorado 5.2 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.2/get-started/tour.html Unlike the URL for colorado 5.6 in the previous section, Example 10 shows that the version segment for tour.adoc now contains the actual version because colorado 5.6 is no longer the latest version of the colorado component. Example 10. URL for colorado 5.6 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.6/get-started/tour.html Nor does Antora set up temporary redirects from URLs with 5.6 to URLs with current. A request for https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.6/get-started/tour.html is served exactly as requested. In Example 11, the version segment uses the symbolic version, current, because colorado 6.0 is the latest version of the colorado component. Example 11. URL for colorado 6.0 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/current/get-started/tour.html Antora sets up new temporary redirects for URLs using the actual version of the latest component version, 6.0, and redirects them to URLs with the symbolic version. For example, if the URL https://docs.example.com/colorado/6.0/get-started/tour.html is requested, the URL redirects to https://docs.example.com/colorado/current/get-started/tour.html.","title":"Latest Version Segment Strategy","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"urls-latest-version-segment-strategy","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/urls-latest-version-segment-strategy.html","titles":[{"text":"latest_version_segment_strategy key","hash":"key","id":1},{"text":"Enable the replace strategy automatically","hash":"default","id":2},{"text":"Redirect to the symbolic version URLs","hash":"redirect-to","id":3},{"text":"What happens when a new component version is added to the site?","hash":"what-happens-when-a-new-component-version-is-added-to-the-site","id":4}]},"218":{"id":218,"text":"The latest_version_segment key replaces the actual version with the symbolic version in the published URLs of the latest component versions.

To ensure portability between host platforms, use lowercase letters. The value of the latest_version_segment key cannot contain spaces, forward slashes (/), or HTML special characters (&, ). The value cannot be null (which also means it cannot be missing or ~). The value can only be an empty string if the value of latest_version_segment_strategy is redirect:to or replace. The value cannot be an empty string if the value of latest_version_segment_strategy is redirect:from. This restriction is due to the fact that adding a redirect on the parent folder could prevent access to other versions. This section explores the results of assigning a symbolic version to the latest_version_segment key. The examples in this section use the component versions defined by the component version descriptor files shown in Example 2 and Example 3. Example 2 defines a component version with the name colorado and version 5.2. Example 2. Component version descriptor (antora.yml file) defining the colorado 5.2 component version name: colorado version: '5.2' (1) 1 The version key in antora.yml defines the component’s actual version as 5.2. Example 3 defines a component version with the name colorado and version 5.6. Example 3. Component version descriptor (antora.yml file) defining the colorado 5.6 component version name: colorado version: '5.6' (1) 1 The version key in antora.yml defines the component’s actual version as 5.6. Both component versions have a page named tour.adoc that belongs to the module get-started. First, let’s review the URLs Antora makes by default. That is, when the latest_version_segment key isn’t set in the playbook. Example 4 specifies the site URL, assigned to the url key, that Antora uses when building absolute URLs and when the URLs are displayed in a browser address bar. Example 4. Playbook (antora-playbook.yml file) showing site url value site: title: The Ranges url: https://docs.example.com content: # ... Assuming Example 2 and Example 3 are the only component versions in the site, Antora identifies colorado 5.6 as the latest version of the colorado component. Antora determines the latest component version and order of versions based on its semantic and named version sorting rules. Using information from the playbook and antora.yml files, Antora constructs the following URLs for the tour.adoc page in each component version. As shown in Example 5, the version segment uses the actual version 5.2 for the tour.adoc page that belongs to the colorado 5.2 component version. Example 5. URL for colorado 5.2 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.2/get-started/tour.html In Example 6, the version segment uses the actual version 5.6 for the tour.adoc page that belongs to the colorado 5.6 component version. Example 6. URL for colorado 5.6 tour.adoc page https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.6/get-started/tour.html While there’s nothing in the URL to signify version 5.6 as the latest version of the component colorado, Antora applies the default sorting order in the reference UI, so version 5.6 is listed first under the colorado component name in the component version selector and first in the listed versions in the page version selector. Now, let’s assign a symbolic version to replace the actual version in the page and asset URLs of the latest component versions. The latest_version_segment key is configured in the playbook file, not the component version descriptor files, because it applies to all of the latest component versions in a site. Example 7 shows a truncated playbook file with the latest_version_segment key defined. Example 7. Playbook (antora-playbook.yml file) defining a symbolic version site: title: The Ranges url: https://docs.example.com urls: latest_version_segment: stable (1) content: # ... 1 The latest_version_segment is set under the urls key and assigned the value stable. Using the component versions defined in Example 2 and Example 3 and the playbook in Example 7, Antora constructs the following URLs for the tour.adoc page in each component version. In Example 8, the version segment uses the actual version because colorado 5.2 isn’t the latest version of the colorado component. Example 8. URL for colorado 5.2 tour.adoc page when latest_version_segment is set https://docs.example.com/colorado/5.2/get-started/tour.html However, in Example 9, the version segment uses the symbolic version, stable, because Antora determined colorado 5.6 is the latest version of the colorado component. Example 9. URL for colorado 5.6 tour.adoc page when latest_version_segment is set https://docs.example.com/colorado/stable/get-started/tour.html The actual version, 5.6, is still displayed in the reference UI menus. The symbolic version, stable, is only used in the URLs. To customize the value displayed in the reference UI menus, use the display_version key. If you want to drop the version segment from the URL, you can do so by setting the value to empty string (which is different from no value, which represents null). Example 10. Playbook that defines an empty symbolic version site: title: The Ranges url: https://docs.example.com urls: latest_version_segment: '' (1) content: # ... 1 Set the value of the latest_version_segment to empty string to drop the version segment from the URL. A page in the latest version will now be accessible from a URL that does not include the version segment. Example 11. URL for colorado 5.6 tour.adoc page when latest_version_segment is empty https://docs.example.com/colorado/get-started/tour.html The version is no longer present in the URL. The actual version, 5.6, is still displayed in the reference UI menus. Recall that you cannot set the latest_version_segment to empty string if the latest_version_segment_strategy is redirect:from. The examples in this section assumed the latest_version_segment_strategy key wasn’t set. Therefore, when Antora detected the latest_version_segment key, it automatically set the latest_version_segment_strategy key and assigned it the replace strategy at runtime. See Latest Version Segment Strategy to learn how the redirect:to and redirect:from strategies work with the latest_version_segment key.","title":"Latest Version Segment","component":"antora","version":"3.1","name":"urls-latest-version-segment","url":"/antora/3.1/playbook/urls-latest-version-segment.html","titles":[{"text":"latest_version_segment key","hash":"key","id":1},{"text":"Value requirements","hash":"value-requirements","id":2},{"text":"Specify a latest version segment","hash":"specify-a-latest-version-segment","id":3}]},"219":{"id":219,"text":"Antora sets up automatic routing for start pages, symbolic latest versions, and page aliases according to the redirect facility you have specified. By default, Antora generates a static HTML file for each URL alias to redirect the visitor to the target page. Antora also has the ability to generate web server-specific configuration files that leverage the web server’s redirect/rewrite facility to handle the routing instead. Antora won’t generate any redirect files (e.g., _redirects) if the site does not define any redirects. Antora derives these URL routes from the site and component version start pages, latest version aliases, and page aliases defined using the page-aliases attribute. For page aliases, the target page is the page to which the source page is redirected. The target page is also where page aliases are defined. The source page is the alias page that’s being redirected (i.e., the claimed page). The playbook key redirect_facility is optional. It can be configured in the playbook or via the CLI and accepts one of the following built-in values: disabled No redirect files are generated. If the site does not define any redirects, this becomes the effective value. gitlab A redirect file for GitLab Pages named _redirects is generated and placed at the root of the published site. httpd A redirect file for Apache httpd named .htaccess is generated and placed at the root of the published site. netlify A redirect file for Netlify named _redirects is generated and placed at the root of the published site. nginx A redirect file for nginx named rewrite.conf is generated and placed at the location .etc/nginx/rewrite.conf in the published site. By default, nginx will not know to look for the file in this location. You either need to move it to where nginx can find it or configure nginx to use it at this location. static (default) A static HTML file with the http-equiv meta element set to refresh is generated at the source page’s URL. The file provides a redirect notice and routes the source page URL to the target page URL. Antora automatically assigns the value static to the redirect_facility key unless you explicitly configure it. The redirect_facility key is configured in the playbook under the urls key. Example 1. antora-playbook.yml urls: redirect_facility: netlify The redirect_facility key can also be configured from the CLI. $ antora --redirect-facility netlify antora-playbook.yml The CLI option overrides the value specified in the playbook. How your site’s URL redirects should be configured depends on the web server or service you use to serve your site. If you use the default redirect facility, Antora will generate HTML pages that use the meta refresh feature of HTML to route the visitor to the target page (i.e., bounce page). When you inspect the output of your site, you will find pages that end with .html that include a tag inside a minimal HTML structure. If you have specified a start page for your site, this will include a index.html page at the root of your published site. If you use any other redirect facility, Antora will not generate these bounce pages. (In other words, don’t expect to find the index.html page at the root of your published site). Instead, Antora relies on the web server to apply the redirect rules that it generates. For details about these rules and where they are written, see the sections below. Redirect rules for start pages and page aliases are defined using the 301 HTTP status code, which means the redirect is considered permanent. Redirect rules for the latest version aliases are defined using the 302 HTTP status code, which means the redirect is considered temporary. The locations in the web server-specific redirect/rewrite rules match the URL of the pages as they are accessed in the site, and thus depend on the value of the urls.html-extension-style key. By default, locations will end with .html. If the HTML URL extension style is changed to indexify, the locations will end with /. Redirect rules for sites served by Netlify are configured in a plain text file named _redirects. When the assigned redirect facility value is netlify, Antora generates the _redirects file and places it at the root of the generated site. Example 2. _redirects file for Netlify generated by Antora /index.html /component/version/index.html 301! / /component/version/index.html 301! /component/version/module/old-name.html /component/version/module/new-name.html 301! The example output above shows redirect rules for two scenarios. The first scenario, which is handled by the first two rules, routes the user from the root domain to the URL of the site start page using a 301 HTTP status code. The second scenario, which is handled by the last rule, routes the user from the URL of a renamed page to its new URL using a 301 HTTP status code. Redirect rules for sites served by GitLab Pages are configured in a plain text file named _redirects. The format of this file is a modified version of the one for Netlify. When the assigned redirect facility value is gitlab, Antora generates the _redirects file and places it at the root of the generated site. Example 3. _redirects file for GitLab Pages generated by Antora /index.html /component/version/index.html 301 / /component/version/index.html 301 /component/version/module/old-name.html /component/version/module/new-name.html 301 (1) 1 Unlike the redirect file for the netlify redirect facility, the rule does not end with !. The example output above shows redirect rules for two scenarios. The first scenario, which is handled by the first two rules, routes the user from the root domain to the URL of the site start page using a 301 HTTP status code. The second scenario, which is handled by the last rule, routes the user from the URL of a renamed page to its new URL using a 301 HTTP status code. Antora generates an nginx rewrite configuration file named rewrite.conf and places it in the generated site at .etc/nginx/rewrite.conf. Example 4. nginx rewrite configuration file generated by Antora location = /index.html { return 301 /component/version/index.html; } location = /component/version/module/old-name.html { return 301 /component/version/module/new-name.html; } The example output above shows redirect rules for two scenarios. The first scenario, which is handled by the first rule, routes the user from the root domain to the URL of the site start page using a 301 HTTP status code. The second scenario, which is handled by the last rule, routes the user from the URL of a renamed page to its new URL using a 301 HTTP status code. When using the nginx redirect facility, Antora assumes that nginx is configured in a way similar to the configuration shown in Example 5. The path /srv/www refers to the location of the generated site. Example 5. nginx configuration that loads the rewrite configuration generated by Antora server { listen 80; server_name _; root /srv/www; location = /.etc/nginx/rewrite.conf { deny all; return 404; } include /srv/www/.etc/nginx/rewrite.conf; location / { index index.html; # uncomment the next line if using --html-url-extension-style=drop #try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/index.html = 404; } error_page 404 /404.html; } Adjust the configuration if your site is accessible from a different hostname or port or is served from a different root. Antora generates an .htaccess file containing redirect rules and places it at the root of the generated site. Example 6. .htaccess file generated by Antora Redirect 301 /index.html /component/version/index.html Redirect 301 /component/version/module/old-name.html /component/version/module/new-name.html The example output above shows redirect rules for two scenarios. The first scenario, which is handled by the first rule, routes the user from the root domain to the URL of the site start page using a 301 HTTP status code. The second scenario, which is handled by the last rule, routes the user from the URL of a renamed page to its new URL using a 301 HTTP status code. When using the httpd redirect facility, Antora assumes that Apache httpd is configured to load the .htaccess file at the root of the hosted site. The static redirect value is useful for sites deployed on services, such as GitLab Pages and GitHub Pages, that don’t accept or provide access to URL redirection configuration files. This setting is also helpful when you build a site on your local machine to test your start pages and page aliases. Antora generates a static meta refresh page for each aliased source page that redirects a visitor to the corresponding target page. Each refresh page contains: The canonical URL of the target page. The http-equiv meta attribute assigned the value refresh. The content meta attribute assigned the value 0 and the URL of the relative target page that the visitor will be redirected to. The 0 indicates that the visitor will be redirected to the target page in 0 seconds. A redirect notice, letting the visitor know that the source page no longer exists and providing a link to the target page. Example 7.

Antora follows the semantic versioning rules. Each Antora component release is versioned major.minor.patch. Major Major releases occur when there are substantial changes in functionality or when new functionality breaks backwards compatibility. Releases within the same major release line will maintain API compatibility. Minor Minor releases add new features, improvements to existing features, and fixes that maintain backwards compatibility. Patch Patch releases fix bugs and maintain backwards compatibility. Only the latest minor release of a major release line will receive patches. Patch releases happen as needed depending on the urgency of the fix. Prerelease Major and minor releases may include prerelease versions (major.minor.patch-alpha.n | -beta.n | -rc.n). Prerelease versions will be tagged as next so that the npm client doesn’t prefer a prerelease over a stable version.
